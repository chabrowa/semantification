VClark McConachy, MBE (15 April 1895 \u2013 12 April 1980), often known simply as Mac, was a New Zealand professional player of English billiards and snooker.McConachy was born at Glenorchy in Otago in 1895. He was the New Zealand professional billiards champion from 1914 until 1980. He also held the title of World Professional Billiards Champion from 1951 until 1968, when he was defeated by Rex Williams.He was the runner-up in the World Snooker Championships of 1932 and 1952. McConachy scored one of the early snooker maximum breaks. He achieved it on Tuesday 19 February 1952 in a practice frame against Pat Kitchen at the Beaufort Club in London on a table reserved for professionals. An official of the Billiards Association and Control Council later examined the table and found it slightly over the standard size and so the break was not accepted as official. At the time Joe Davis held the record for the highest official break of 146. The match between McConachy and Horace Lindrum for the World Championship started the following Monday.Clark was a keen advocate of physical fitness and regularly ran up to four miles every day. A strict teetotaller and non-smoker, he attributed his continued success well into his senior years to these things. He was also well known for walking around the table on his hands before the match started. He is a member of the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame. In the 1964 Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for community and charitable services. He died at his residence in the Auckland suburb of Greenlane on 12 April 1980.

VWillie Smith (25 January 1886 \u2013 2 June 1982) was an English professional player of snooker and English billiards. Smith was "by common consent, the greatest all-round billiards player who ever lived".He studied previous Billiard players such as Melbourne Inman, Harry Stevenson, Tom Reece, Edward Diggle and George Gray, describing his play as "the combination of Gray's striking and Diggle's top-of-the-table play".He entered the World Billiards Championship in 1920 and then again in 1923, winning it on both occasions. Arguments with the governing body prevented him from taking part in the competition more often.In 1930 he started writing for The Burwat Billiard Review, a magazine published by the Cue Sport Manufacturers Bourroughes and Watts. These were instructional articles with accompanying illustrations and photographs.He turned to snooker for purely monetary reasons but never really took to the game. His natural talent as a billiards player still enabled him to reach the World Snooker Championship final in 1933 and 1935 where he was beaten by Joe Davis.

VPatsy Fagan (born 15 January 1951 in Dublin) is a retired Irish professional snooker player.After winning the first UK Championship in 1977 (when it was a non-ranking event), Fagan seemed destined for a long and successful professional career in the game and was touted as a future world champion, but he became affected by a bout of the "yips". This illness made him reluctant to play shots with the rest when situations demanded it, and hence he struggled to live up to the potential it was believed he had. Although he remained a professional for many years, this problem continued, and he gave up the game far earlier (in 1989) than might have been expected.Fagan is currently coach of the Paddington professional Alfred Burden. He also regularly commentates for Eurosport's snooker coverage, particularly across Players Tour Championship events.

VAnthony Davies (born 2 December 1969) is a former Welsh professional snooker player.Davies started playing snooker aged 12. He made his first century break made aged 15 and his first maximum break aged 17. After winning a number of titles in Wales, in 1991 Davies turned professional. His best performance was at the 1996 European Open, where he reached the quarter-finals. In 2002 he also reached the last 16 of the World Championship. Davies remained in the top 32 in the world rankings for three seasons, peaking at #26, until a disappointing 2003/2004 season in which he failed to win a match. After failing to regain his form, he retired from snooker in 2006.Since 1998, he has been an official coach for World Snooker. He has established two junior clubs in the South Wales area, helping to increase participation levels and improve playing performance amongst local snooker players. In April 2008 he worked on a pilot scheme, called \u2018KIS\u2019 [Kids Into Snooker], set up by Cuefactor in conjunction with the Paul Hunter Foundation, the aim being to help generate interest in snooker amongst disadvantaged young people.Davies made a brief return to competitive snooker in 2013, entering the sixth event of the European Tour, the Kay Suzanne Memorial Cup. Having come through the amateur rounds, he then defeated Anthony McGill and Nigel Bond to reach the last 32, where he lost to Joel Walker.

VAdrian Gunnell (born August 24, 1972) is an English former professional snooker player from Telford. He has reached the last-16 in four world ranking events (three in Asia, in three different seasons, and at the 2008 Grand Prix), but has yet to progress beyond that stage. He has yet to qualify for the final stages of the World Championship.While practising in 2003 he pulled off the remarkable feat of compiling three 147 breaks in 4 frames, the only player to do so. He hasn't been able to bring that kind of form to the tournaments, but he has compiled a 147 in tournament play. He is noted for taking a long time to play safety shots.Notable victories he achieved during the 2007/2008 season included beating Marco Fu 5\u20133 in last 48 of the Northern Ireland Trophy, and Matthew Stevens 9\u20137 at the same stage of the 2007 UK Championship from 5\u20137 behind, to qualify for the final stages of the event played in his home town for the first time. He lost to Peter Ebdon 5\u20132 and Ding Junhui 9\u20133 in the last 32 of both tournaments respectively, but his consistent performances have taken him up to number 36 in the 2008/2009 rankings. He also had a notable run in the 2008 Grand Prix, upsetting former World Champion Shaun Murphy 5-3 in the first round (Murphy went on to win the UK Championship and reach the final of the World Championship later in the same season), then coming from 3-0 down against Steve Davis to level at 3-3 and 4-4 and lead by over forty points in the deciding frame, before Davis produced a great clearance to the pink to snatch victory.The 2011/12 season was rather average only qualifying for 2 of the 8 ranking events, the UK Championship and the German Masters, both losing in the first round to Mark Allen and Stephen Lee. At the end of the season, he finished No 69 outside of the top 64, but he played in the Q School events but didn't manage to qualify for the main tour by reaching the Quarter-finals in any of the 3 events and then lost his place in the main tour soon afterwards.

VGraeme Dott (born 12 May 1977) is a Scottish professional snooker player and snooker coach from Larkhall. He turned professional in 1994 and first entered the top 16 in 2001. He has won two ranking titles, the 2006 World Snooker Championship and the 2007 China Open, and was runner-up in the World Championships of 2004 and 2010. He reached number 2 in the world rankings in 2007, but a subsequent episode of clinical depression seriously affected his form, causing him to drop to number 28 for the 2009/2010 season. He then recovered his form, regained his top-16 ranking, and reached a third World Championship final. In 2011, he published his autobiography, Frame of Mind: The Autobiography of the World Snooker Champion.

VStephen Lee (born 12 October 1974) is an English former professional snooker player. He turned professional in 1992 and was ranked in the top 16 between the 1997/1998 and 2007/2008 snooker seasons, reaching a career-high of fifth in the rankings. He won four ranking titles between 1998 and 2006, reached the semi-finals of the 2003 world championship and the final of the 2008 Masters. Thereafter, his form declined dramatically and as a result he dropped out of the top 16 after a run of eleven consecutive seasons, meaning he would no longer automatically qualify for tournaments. A return to form in the 2011/2012 season saw Lee reach two consecutive finals in ranking tournaments and collect his fifth title, as well as regaining his top 16 seeding. Lee was a heavy break-builder compiling 174 competitive century breaks during his career, and his smooth cue action is regarded by some pundits as the most natural the game has seen.Lee's playing career came to a premature end when he was suspended from WSA competition on 12 October 2012 on match-fixing charges. He was found guilty by an independent tribunal in September 2013 of influencing the outcome of seven matches in 2008 and 2009. He received a twelve-year ban backdated to the start of his suspension and which will run until 12 October 2024.

Although the dominant snooker player in Australia, he was eclipsed by Joe Davis who he never beat on level terms. Lindrum contested three World Championship finals against Davis, in 1936, 1937 and 1946, losing all three but coming closer than anyone to beating him. When past his best, Lindrum won the 1952 World Championship which, because of a dispute between the governing body and the players' association, was only contested by himself and New Zealander Clark McConachy.

He has reached the finals of two ranking tournaments and the semi-finals of the 2011 Masters. Cope entered the top 16 in the world rankings earlier in that season, but thereafter developed a tremor which has been attributed to being either an essential tremor or the yips, which makes his cue arm shake. This condition has caused Cope to slip markedly down the rankings in recent years which saw him drop out of the top 64 at the end of the 2014/2015 season. He has a fast, entertaining style of play, being nicknamed "Shotgun" due to his speed around the table and aggressive playing style and Brown tooth because he has a brown tooth..

VSean Storey (born 19 August 1971 in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, England) is a former English professional snooker player.His best ranking performance to date came in the World Championship in 2003, where he bowed out in the last 16, losing 7-13 to John Higgins. Previously he had qualified for the World Championship in 2001, but lost 10-9 to Joe Swail after leading 9-7. His best season was 2002/03 when he won 28 matches overall - the most out of anyone on the tour. He suffered a drop in form in the following season, winning just three matches (although he was now entering tournaments at a later stage). Having been provisionally as high as #26 during the 2003/2004 season, he ended up at #50, and dropped to #68 a year later.His best ranking break to date was a 145 in the 2001 British Open. In 1997, Storey became the first cueist to compile two maximum breaks in the same pro-am tournament. In the 2004/5 season, he picked up GB13,650 in prize money.

VBernard Bennett (31 August 1931 \u2014 12 January 2002) was an English professional player of snooker and English billiards, whose career spanned twenty-six years between 1969 and 1995.Aside from his playing career, Bennett played an important but largely-overlooked role in the development of snooker and billiards during the 1970s and early 1980s. He was known more as an organiser, supporter and promoter of both games than as a player.Bennett turned professional in 1969, without any significant amateur record. By entering the 1969 World Snooker Championship, and paying the almost prohibitive 100 entrance fee, Bennett enabled a straight knockout tournament to be held, although he was heavily defeated in the first round 4\u201325 by Rex Williams. He competed in the 1970 event but was defeated in the first round 8\u201311 by David Taylor.Bennett's efforts led to the resurrection of the World Professional Billiards Championship in 1971, after a hiatus of three years. Bennett provided both the financial guarantee, the venue for the event, and the opposition, but was heavily defeated by defending champion Rex Williams 9,250-4,058.Bennett was a founding member of the Professional Billiards Players' Association when it was reformed in 1969, and, in addition to being a player, was a well-respected administrator and coach for many years. Bennett was the owner of the Castle Club in Southampton, which was one of the first modern snooker centres. From here, he organised many pro-am events in both snooker and billiards, also hosting mini 'triangular' events featuring three professionals. The Castle Pro-Am event (which Bennett financially supported) was a popular addition to the snooker scene, and was usually held in December of every year. Bennett, who had accrued his money from the building trade, went on to own other snooker clubs in the Southampton area.The Castle Pro-Am event proved beneficial to a number of professional players; at the end of the 1975/76 season, Alex Higgins, who was placed second on that season's Order of Merit, had earned only 2,250 from the three main events of the season, but won 500 as the victor of the 1975 edition alone.Bennett played better snooker when closer to his home in Southampton, and in the 1977/78 season, he defeated both John Pulman 3\u20130 and Doug Mountjoy 5\u20132 in that season's Castle Pro-Am tournament. Bennett held eventual winner John Spencer to 3\u20133 in the semi-final of this tournament, before Spencer won 5\u20133.Bennett played both snooker and billiards into the 1990s, retiring from professional play in 1995. His final professional match was a 5-0 loss to Alfie Burden in qualifying for the 1995 World Championship.Bennett died, a figure of unanimous affection throughout the sport of snooker, in January 2002, at the age of 70.

VMark Davis (born 12 August 1972) is an English professional snooker player from St. Leonards in Sussex, England. Davis became professional in 1991 but for many years was considered something of a journeyman; however, he vastly improved his game in the late 2000s, and as a result managed to get in the top 16 for the first time in 2012. The highlights of his career so far have been winning the Benson & Hedges Championship in 2002 (earning him an appearance at the Masters), and the six-red snooker world championships three times (in 2009, 2012 and 2013).

VStephen Gordon Hendry, MBE (born 13 January 1969) is a Scottish former professional snooker player, described by World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, the governing body of men's professional snooker, as being "generally considered the greatest snooker player ever", although much expert opinion in the game regards his rival, Ronnie O'Sullivan, as the greatest player.Hendry became the youngest professional snooker player in 1985 aged 16 and, in 1990, he was the youngest-ever snooker World Champion, at the age of 21. He won the World Championship seven times, a record in the modern era, and was snooker's world number one for eight consecutive seasons between 1990 and 1998, and again in 2006/2007. Hendry has the distinction of winning the most world ranking titles (36) and is second on the century break list behind Ronnie O'Sullivan with 775 competitive century breaks. He has made 11 competitive maximum breaks, second only to Ronnie O'Sullivan. In May 2012 he retired from the sport to concentrate on his commercial interests, and also works as a commentator for the BBC.

VSteve Davis, OBE (born 22 August 1957) is an English former professional snooker player from Plumstead, London. Known for dominating the sport during the 1980s, when he won the World Championship six times and was ranked world number one for seven consecutive seasons, he is remembered particularly for contesting the 1985 World Championship final with Dennis Taylor, the black-ball conclusion of which attracted a record 18.5 million British viewers. He is a well known public figure and is generally viewed by his peers as one of the greatest players of all time. Until his retirement in 2016, Davis combined his ongoing playing career with his role as a television analyst and commentator for the BBC's snooker coverage, alongside being a DJ of electronic music on local radio station Phoenix FM and at the Bloc Weekend music festival.In addition to his six world titles, Davis's career achievements include three Masters and a record six UK Championship titles. He won a total of 28 ranking events (tying with John Higgins and Ronnie O'Sullivan, and behind only Stephen Hendry) and made over 5.5 million in prize money. Davis compiled more than 300 competitive century breaks, including the first officially recognised (and first televised) maximum break in professional competition, in 1982. During the 1987/1988 season, he became the first player to complete snooker's Triple Crown by winning the UK Championship, Masters, and World Championship in the same season. His other accomplishments include winning the World Doubles Championship four times with Tony Meo and winning the World Team Classic/World Cup four times with England.Davis won his last world title in 1989, and captured his last major title when he won the 1997 Masters at the age of 39, but he continued to play snooker at a high level into his 50s. He reached the final of the 2005 UK Championship at the age of 48 and was still ranked inside the top 16 when he turned 50 during the 2007/2008 season. He reached the quarter-finals of the 2010 World Championship at the age of 52, making him the oldest quarter-finalist since Eddie Charlton in 1983. He won the World Seniors Championship in 2013. On 17 April 2016, after failing to qualify for the 2016 World Snooker Championship, Davis announced his retirement from professional play.Outside snooker, Davis has competed in pool tournaments, notably playing on Team Europe at the Mosconi Cup between 1994 and 2004, helping the team win the event in 1995 and 2002. He is also noted for his participation in poker events, having reached the final stages of several televised tournaments. Since 1996 he has been a regular broadcaster with Phoenix FM and an expert in the progressive rock genres of Zeuhl, RIO and the Canterbury scene. A keen amateur chess player, he has co-authored two chess books with grandmaster David Norwood and is a former president of the British Chess Federation. He has also published several books on snooker, as well as three cookbooks. He has appeared on a number of popular British TV shows, including I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in 2013. He was made an MBE in 1988 and an OBE in 2001.

VPatrick "Pat" Houlihan (1929\u20132006) was an English snooker player. He was born in Deptford, London.Pat Houlihan turned professional in 1971 at the age of 42 after many years as an amateur including beating future world champion John Spencer 11-3 at Blackpool Tower during the 1965 World Amateur Championship. Additionally, he lifted the BA&CC television tournament, one of snooker's first televised events.During his professional career his highest position in the world rankings was 18th, which he reached in 1979. His highest break at the televised stages of the World Championship played at the Crucible was 83. He played in the main stages of the World Championship twice: in 1973 when he lost to then defending champion Alex Higgins, and at the Crucible in 1978 when he lost to Cliff Thorburn in the first round. He retired in 1993 and vanished from the game.His early career had been stymied by world champion turned snooker star, Joe Davis, who was responsible for selecting new professionals and disapproved of amateurs such as Houlihan who had played matches at various snooker clubs for money.Despite his cult status, there was no braggadocio about Patsy's manner, which was always modest and unassuming. He was also a mesmerising storyteller, possessing a vast store of snooker-related anecdotes, as well as a dazzling repertoire of coin tricks.Patsy had a cameo role in Les Reid's 1984 film- Number One -playing the part of Pete Phelan. It starred Bob Geldof and Mel Smith.He was married with three grown-up children.His friend, Jimmy White now a snooker legend himself, once described him as "the greatest snooker player I've ever seen", and White's own brand of attacking snooker owed much to his fellow south Londoner. Jimmy White has rated Charlie Poole, Patsy Houlihan and Alex Higgins as the three greatest snooker players he has ever seen, reasoning that they were "Potters and entertainers. Safety shots were too boring for them."Warren King: " I think Patsy was still playing in pro events when I first started playing on the tour in the early eighties. I did not really know him, but he was a great character and player in his time."Frank Sandell: "I only met him a couple of times, though his reputation as both, a superb player and character, was without question." "He did an exhibition for a children's charity, in around 1981, and was brilliant with the kids.He played at Rommiley Forum- Stockport- in the World qualifiers, in the last time I saw him. I don't think he could afford a hotel, so he bunked down on a fellow player's bedroom floor." "He was full of amazing stories about the game and of East End life."Houlihan beat Reardon 6-5 in the English amateur semi, after trailing 5-1. Reardon, whose full-time job was a policeman at the time, lamented 'I should be locked up... " - Paul Smith.Mike Wilson: It's a shame there is no television footage of Patsy. My old man (Cliff Wilson) told me Patsy was a joy to watch.Ann-Marie Farren, former ladies World Champion: I played Patsy in Leigh-on-Sea once and he was only allowed to pot the yellow as a colour. He was such a nice bloke. I will take a look at your page to the great man.Later, Houlihan beat John Spencer 11-3 to win the 1965 English Amateur Championship but was blocked from turning professional for several more years. Spencer was invited instead to compete in the world championships in Karachi as Patsy had a previous engagement: four months in Wormwood Scrubs for breaking into a warehouse.

VDavid "Dave" Harold (born 9 December 1966) is an English former professional snooker player from Stoke-on-Trent. He was known by the nicknames of "the Hard Man" and "the Stoke Potter" (conflating his home city's pottery industry and his profession of potting snooker balls). He was also the first player on the television circuit to sport a plaster on his chin as a guide for his cue, which is a practice now adopted by Graeme Dott. As an amateur he played as David Harold, but since turning professional in 1991 he was registered as Dave Harold. He has three children, and is separated from his wife.He won one ranking title, reached two further finals and several semi-finals, and spent four seasons ranked among the top 16. Harold was renowned for both his very strong defensive play and his unusual cue-action, with which he is able to unleash a great deal of power on a shot without using backswing on the cue. Despite safety play ultimately being considered his strong point, he compiled 112 century breaks, putting him 22nd on the all-time list. Steve Davis has commented that he is not the most naturally gifted player, but makes up for this with strong tactical play. For his technique and grinding play he has been compared to Cliff Thorburn.

VTom Newman (23 March 1894 \u2013 30 September 1943) was an English professional player of English billiards and snooker. He was born Thomas Edgar Pratt in Barton-on-Humber, Lincolnshire. He always appeared under the name Tom Newman when playing billiards or snooker and changed his name formally in 1919, shortly before his marriage that year.He established himself as the best billiards players of the 1920s, appearing in every World Professional Billiards Championship final between 1921 and 1930, and winning the title six times. In the last five of these final he met Joe Davis, winning twice (1926 & 1927) and losing three times (1928, 1929 & 1930).Newman was a great break builder at billiards, and was a master of the cannon shot. His first century break at the "three ball game" came when he was 16 years of age; and in the 1930-31 season he made 134 breaks of 1000.Like many players of that era he regarded snooker as the less "serious" of the two sports, but nevertheless he made an officially recognized record snooker break of 89 in 1919. In 1934 he was one of two entries for the World Championship, the other being defending champion Joe Davis. Davis won 25\u201322, although at one stage Newman led 14\u201313.Newman died at his home in Tufnel Park, London on 30 September 1943 aged 49. He had had throat trouble for several years. He left a wife and daughter.

VJohn Higgins, MBE (born 18 May 1975) is a Scottish professional snooker player. Since turning professional in 1992, he has won 28 ranking titles, including four World Championships and three UK Championships, as well as two Masters titles, making him one of the most successful players in the modern history of the sport.In terms of world titles in the modern era, Higgins is fifth behind Stephen Hendry (7), Steve Davis (6), Ray Reardon (6) and Ronnie O'Sullivan (5). He has 28 career ranking titles, putting him in joint second place with Davis and O'Sullivan, behind Hendry (36). Known as a prolific break-builder, he has compiled 604 century breaks in professional tournament play, placing him third behind O'Sullivan and Hendry. He has also compiled 7 competitive maximum breaks, placing him third behind O'Sullivan (13) and Hendry (11). For 16 consecutive full seasons from 1996/1997 to 2011/2012, Higgins never fell below 6th in the world rankings, and was world number 1 on four occasions.In 2010, the News of the World tabloid newspaper carried out a sting operation in a hotel room in Ukraine, which claimed to show Higgins and his then-manager arranging to lose specific frames in future matches for money. Although an investigation cleared Higgins of match-fixing allegations, it found that he had brought the sport into disrepute by failing to report, and giving the impression of agreeing with, an invitation to breach the sport's betting rules. The WPBSA banned Higgins from professional competition for six months and fined him 75,000. He returned to the tour midway through the 2010/2011 season.After his return to snooker, Higgins added a third UK Championship title and claimed his fourth world title in 2011. He subsequently experienced a noted slump in form, and between 2012 and 2014 only won the 2012 Shanghai Masters. He has spoken frequently in this period about his struggles with confidence and consistency. However, in 2015, Higgins returned to winning ways, capturing three ranking titles.

VRonald Antonio O'Sullivan, OBE (born 5 December 1975) is an English professional snooker and pool player. He is widely regarded as the greatest player in the sport's modern era. He is noted for his rapid playing style, mercurial temperament and his ambivalent relationship with the sport, from which he has taken prolonged sabbaticals and repeatedly threatened to retire.A childhood snooker prodigy, O'Sullivan made his first century break at age 10 and his first maximum break at age 15. He turned professional in 1992, at the age of 16, and soon earned the nickname "The Rocket" because of his rapid playing style. He achieved his first major professional success when he won the 1993 UK Championship at the age of 17 years and 358 days, making him the youngest player ever to win a ranking title, a record he still holds. He is also the youngest player to have won the Masters, having captured his first title in 1995 at the age of 19 years and 69 days.His record in Triple Crown events now stands at five World Championship, six Masters, and five UK Championship titles. His career total of 28 ranking titles puts him in joint second place (with Steve Davis and John Higgins) behind Stephen Hendry, who has 36, and his career earnings of over 8 million put him on second place after Hendry on snooker's all-time prize-money list. O'Sullivan has held the world number one ranking on multiple occasions, most recently during the 2009/2010 season. His other achievements include ten Premier League titles and winning the Nations Cup with England in 2000.Known as a prolific break-builder, O'Sullivan holds the record for the most competitive century breaks, with 824. He also holds the record for the most ratified maximum breaks in professional competition (13) and for the three fastest competitive maximum breaks, the quickest in 5 minutes and 20 seconds.

VGerard Eamonn Greene (born 12 November 1973 in Chatham, Kent, South East England) is a Northern Irish former professional snooker player. He represented Northern Ireland in international events, as his parents are from Belfast.He enjoyed moderate success in his career, reaching his highest ranking, 26th, for the 2004/2005 season, and has reached one ranking final, at the 2014 Players Championship Grand Final, where he lost 4\u20130 to Barry Hawkins. Alongside this, Greene reached a ranking semi-final, at the 2007 Grand Prix, losing to the eventual champion Marco Fu, and five quarter-finals.Representing Northern Ireland with teammate Mark Allen, he reached the final of the 2011 World Cup, where they lost to China.Greene qualified for the World Championship five times without winning a match at the Crucible Theatre, although he twice drew the defending champion \u2013 John Higgins in 1999, and Peter Ebdon in 2003. He was ranked within the world's top 64 players from 1997 until he fell off the main tour, losing his professional status, in 2016.In his match against Steve Davis in the 1996 Grand Prix, Greene notably went in-off on the final black to decide the frame three times - thus losing all three frames - in a 5\u20130 defeat, his opponent subsequently dubbing him "the unluckiest man in the snooker world".

VPatrick Wallace (born September 20, 1969) is a former professional snooker player from Dungannon in Northern Ireland. He is an accountancy graduate from Queen's University, Belfast (1992). Wallace captained the Queen's team to the British Universities title at Leeds in 1992 and won his first Northern Ireland title the following year before reaching the semi-finals of the world amateur championship.Wallace was the only player to have reached the quarter-finals of the World Championship on their only appearance at the finals, before Anthony McGill managed it in 2015. He achieved this in 2001, beating Alan McManus 10\u20132 and Mark King 13\u20135 on his way before being knocked out by his good friend and fellow countryman Joe Swail, losing 11\u201313. He has failed to reach the Crucible stages of the world championship since then. His percentage of points scored to points conceded at the Crucible is the third-highest of all time, behind only Stephen Hendry and John Higgins, albeit based on a single year.Wallace dropped off the Main Tour after the 2005/2006 season. He returned to the tour for 2007/2008 after winning the Northern Ireland Championship, and kept his place for the next four seasons. Following his 10\u20139 defeat at the hands of Matthew Selt in the penultimate round of qualifying for the 2011 World Snooker Championship, he announced his retirement from the game. Wallace had however entered PTC1 but withdrew from the event without playing a match.In spite of his retirement, Wallace participated in the qualifying rounds for the 2012 World Snooker Championship. He defeated John Parrott 5\u20130 in the first preliminary qualifying round before beating Joe Delaney 5\u20132 in the second preliminary round; however, he was defeated in the second qualifying round 10\u20139 by Yu Delu.

VMichaela Tabb (born 11 December 1967, in Bath, England) is a Scottish snooker and pool referee, notable for establishing significant milestones for women officials in professional snooker.She began refereeing professionally on the pool circuit in 1997, and has officiated at top pool tournaments such as the WPA World Nine-ball Championship and the Mosconi Cup. After qualifying in 2001 to referee on the professional snooker tour, she went on to become the sport's highest profile female referee. During her 14 years on the tour, she became the first woman to officiate at a professional ranking snooker tournament (2002), the first woman to referee a ranking tournament final (2007), and the only woman ever to have refereed the World Snooker Championship final (2009 and 2012).Her professional snooker refereeing career came to an end when she abruptly left the tour in March 2015. She subsequently brought a court case against the sport's governing body, alleging sex discrimination, unfair dismissal, and breach of contract. An out-of-court settlement was reached in September 2015, under which Tabb was paid an undisclosed sum.She is also a former player on the women's eight-ball pool circuit, where she won a number of titles as a solo competitor and as a member, and later captain, of the Scottish Ladies' Pool Team.

VDavid "Dave" Finbow is a former English professional snooker player from Worcester. In his career he managed to beat players such as Ronnie O'Sullivan, Ken Doherty and James Wattana. Throughout his career he reached five quarter-finals in ranking tournaments, as well as the last 16 of many events and he once looked as if he could get into the top 16 of the world rankings. However, his results in tournaments suffered, which was partly due to suffering from anxiety attacks which caused him to feel nauseated and unable to concentrate in a match. Unfortunately for Finbow he could not find a cure, and despite taking prescribed medication and trying a number of solutions it did not cure his anxiety attacks completely. After beating David Gray and Dave Harold to reach the last 16 of the 2001 UK Championship he was playing Ronnie O'Sullivan, but suffered a particularly bad anxiety attack, and was forced to retire the match at 8-0 down. After the match he expressed his distress and by the end of the 2002-2003 season he announced his retirement from the game altogether.

He beat 2005 champion Shaun Murphy in qualifying to reach the 2004 World Championships. He has spent 11 seasons on the prosnookertour, with a highest ranking of 35 (2009/10 season).He had ten last-32 defeats before he first reached the last 16 of a ranking event. He started 2007/2008 strongly, reaching the last 16 of the opening Shanghai Masters (winning 4 matches before benefitting from Ronnie O'Sullivan's withdrawal) and then qualifying for the final stages of the Grand Prix by winning all 7 group games. His form tailed off after this, but he had a strong run in the 2009 China Open, defeating Mark Allen, Ali Carter and Graeme Dott to reach his first career semi-final. Pettman qualified for the 2010 World Championship, but was beaten 10\u20131 in the first round by Ding Junhui. Following 10\u20132 defeats by Mark Williams and Stephen Hendry in 2003 and 2004 respectively, this means Pettman's win/loss ratio of frames played at the Crucible is 5\u201330.Pettman retired from professional snooker after the 2010/2011 season. He has recently been playing American pool, including at the 2013 Derby City Classic, where he scored the high run in 14.1 Straight Pool.

VLuc Salvas (born November 21, 1962) is a Canadian professional pool player. His quick-paced speed pool play has earned him the nickname "Machine Gun".Born in Montreal, Quebec, in 2006, he won the first International Speed Pool Challenge and the US$50,000 winner-take-all purse by defeating Great Britain's Dave Pearson. He returned the next year to defend his title but was defeated in the semi-finals by Bobby McGrath of the United States, the eventual winner of the tournament. In 2009, Salvas returned to play in the same tournament and won it for the second time, defeating Pearson again in the finals. He successfully defended his title in 2010 by defeating McGrath.Despite his fast performance, he has yet to dominate any of the major nine-ball or eight-ball tournaments.

VJack Karnehm (18 June 1917, Tufnell Park, north London, England \u2013 28 July 2002, Crowthorne, Berkshire) was a British snooker commentator, who was regularly heard on BBC television from 1978 until 1993, and a former amateur world champion and professional national champion at the game of English billiards. Karnehm was also a professional snooker and billiards player.Besides his commentary, perhaps his major contribution to the game was his development of the swivel-lens glasses, which enabled Dennis Taylor to win the World Snooker Championship in 1985. These were spectacles which were set at a compensatory angle, so the player could look along the shot through the optical centre of the lens. The originals had been designed by Theodore Hamblin, and pioneered by Fred Davis in 1938. Karnehm, who had served a five-year spectacle-making apprenticeship, made many pairs in his family business, but his upside-down design was a considerable improvement - it offered wider peripheral vision - and helped Taylor win the 1985 world title. It has helped countless players since.Despite being best-known to snooker audiences, Karnehm's passion was billiards. As a non-professional player, he was a ten-time London Amateur Billiards Champion, and also won the English Amateur Billiards Championship in 1969. That October, he took the World Amateur Champion title.Karnehm turned professional in 1970, reaching the world finals in 1971 and 1973, losing to Leslie Driffield and Rex Williams respectively.In 1980, Karnehm beat Williams to win the UK Billiards Championship, his only professional title. Karnehm also turned professional in snooker in 1971, his best result coming when losing 5-4 to Chris Ross in the U.K. Championship of 1977. Karnehm was also a noted snooker coach, and, in 1985, released an instructional video, Understanding Modern Snooker.
