VRichard Anthony McKenzie (born April 15, 1971) is a former American football linebacker. An All-American linebacker in high school, McKenzie starred at Penn State and left the team after the 1992 season though a dominant linebacker and considered by some to be the best athlete on that year's football team, Mckenzie was benched in the final bowl game after discipline issues with Coach Joe Paterno. As his off-the-field issues scared off many NFL teams, McKenzie was not selected until the sixth round of the 1993 NFL Draft. After three years and only eight game appearances he left the NFL.

VLinwood Bookard "Lin" Sexton (born April 16, 1926) is a former American football halfback who played for the Los Angeles Dons. He played college football at Wichita State University, having previously attended East High School in Wichita. He was one of the first African-American college football players to play for Wichita State, and in the Missouri Valley Conference, and thus was barred from participating in certain games and was forced to make separate travel arrangements due to the segregation policies in place at the time. He was named to the All-Conference team in 1945, 1946, and 1947, the first African-American player to have accomplished the feat. The Linwood Sexton Endowed Scholarship from his alma mater, Wichita State, is named in his honor. In 2011, he was inducted into the Missouri Valley Conference Athletics Hall of Fame. He is also a member of the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame (inducted 2001).

VThomas Joseph Sestak (March 9, 1936 \u2013 April 3, 1987) was an American football defensive lineman who played for the Buffalo Bills of the American Football League (AFL).In 1962, following an innovative AFL trend of drafting players from small colleges, the Bills drafted Sestak as a tight end in the 17th round from McNeese State University. Sestak would never play that position for the Bills, but instead became one of the league's greatest defensive tackles. At 6-4, he had the size, speed and strength to handle any offensive lineman.Sestak was a starter in his rookie year and, until a series of knee injuries ended his career after the 1967 season, used his strength to dominate the line of scrimmage. Sestak was a three-time selection to All-American Football League teams and a unanimous All-AFL defensive tackle in three consecutive years; 1963, 1964 and 1965. Sestak served as the cornerstone of a defense that took the Bills to the playoffs four straight years (1963\u20131966) and consecutive AFL championships in 1964 and 1965. Over the 1964 and 1965 seasons, Sestak and his defense mates held opposing rushers without a touchdown for seventeen consecutive games, a Professional Football record that still stands. Twice during his outstanding career he realized the defensive lineman's "dream", returning interceptions for touchdowns, and once returned a recovered fumble for a score.His teammates described his play as "crazy as hell".During the 1960s, only six professional defensive linemen were unanimous All-League selections for three or more years, Sestak (3), Bob Lily (5), Merlin Olsen (4), Willie Davis (3), Gino Marchetti (3), and Deacon Jones (3). The latter five, all former NFL players, have already been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, while Sestak, a star from the AFL, like many other AFL players has been ignored by the Hall of Fame selectors.In January 1970, Sestak was selected as a member of the All-Time All-AFL Team, and in 2009 as a member of the Bills' 50th Anniversary Team. In 2007, Tom Sestak was inducted into the National Polish American Sports Hall of Fame.Sestak died of a heart attack in 1987.

VMichael Lewis "Mike" Webster (March 18, 1952 \u2013 September 24, 2002) was an American football player who played as a center in the National Football League from 1974 to 1990 with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Kansas City Chiefs. He is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, class of 1997. Nicknamed "Iron Mike", Webster anchored the Steelers' offensive line during much of their run of four Super Bowl victories from 1974 to 1979 and is considered by some as the best center in NFL history.Webster was the first former NFL player diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Since his death, he has become a symbol for head injuries in the NFL and the ongoing debate over player safety. His doctors were of the opinion that multiple concussions during his career damaged his frontal lobe, which caused cognitive dysfunction.Webster died at the age of 50. His cause of death was first announced to be a heart attack by the Steelers' management, but this was later recanted. Webster's cause of death has not been released from the hospital at his family's request.

VMark George Miller (born August 13, 1956 in Canton, Ohio) is a former American football quarterback. He played with the Cleveland Browns (1978\u20131979) before being traded in August 1980 to the Green Bay Packers, where he saw no action. Miller then briefly resurfaced with the Michigan Panthers of the United States Football League in 1983.Miller had put together a solid college career with Bowling Green State University (1974\u20131977), resulting in the Browns making him a third round selection in the 1978 NFL Draft. During his brief career his role was that of a backup quarterback, consequently making his playing time limited. He attempted 47 passes, completed 15 for only 243 yards, seeing the most action in the 1978 regular season finale against the Cincinnati Bengals after replacing an injured Brian Sipe.

He attended Wilmington High School in Massachusetts and played college football for the Boston College Eagles.Esposito was a participant in the 1974 East-West Shrine Game. As part of the game, each player would visit the Shriners Hospitals for Children. While visiting, he noticed Nicole Worley-Urteaga, a 2-year-old patient with Holt-Oram syndrome. She appeared scared and was crying. Esposito took her hand to calm her down and they walked down the hallway together. A photographer from a local newspaper noticed the scene and snapped a photo of the two. The image became the inspiration for the official logo of the East-West Shrine Game and is displayed annually on the 50-yard line.

In a 1995 divisional playoff game against the Chicago Bears, he became the first and only rookie to score three touchdowns in a playoff game. He also scored a touchdown in the NFC title game, assisting the 49ers to a 38\u201328 win over the Dallas Cowboys after 2 frustrating losses to Dallas in the previous 2 NFC Championship Games.

He was leading the NFL in receptions (47) at the time of the injury.He finished his career playing with the Carolina Panthers from 1998 through 2000. In his 7 NFL seasons, Floyd rushed for 1,141 yards, caught 191 passes for 1,427 yards, returned 1 kickoff for 22 yards, and scored 25 touchdowns (20 rushing and 5 receiving).He lives in Orlando, Florida, with his wife Bonita and their three children William, Thai and Jaden. The family is active in his non-profit community-benefit foundation, William Floyd\u2019s Bar None Foundation ('Bar None' was his nickname while playing with the 49ers).On April 30, 2008, Florida State University and ISP Sports announced that Floyd, who helped win a national championship for the Seminoles in 1993, will join Gene Deckerhoff as color analyst on the Seminole ISP Sports Network for radio broadcasts of FSU football games. Floyd is also in his third season as a color analyst on Tailgate Overtime, airing live every Monday at 7PM on Sunshine Network during the college football season.

VBilly Joe Hobert (born January 8, 1971) is a former professional American football quarterback. While at the University of Washington, he led the Huskies to a national championship in 1991, during his redshirt sophomore season. He was elevated to the starting position after junior Mark Brunell suffered a serious knee injury during spring drills, causing him to miss much of the 1991 season.After the success of the 1991 season, Hobert became implicated in a major NCAA scandal when it was revealed he had received a series of loans totaling $50,000 made by the father-in-law of a friend while Hobert himself had no assets and no specific payment schedule. This would cost Hobert his college eligibility, and was an aggravating factor in the University receiving PAC-10 sanctions for lack of institutional control, in turn leading to head coach Don James resigning in protest. Although several other Huskies players were implicated in improprieties, Hobert became the most well-known face of the sanctions, leading to him receiving death threats.1991 Season: 173/285 for 2,271 yards with 22 TDs, 10 INTs, 56 yards rushing and 5 TDs.Hobert was the 58th pick in the 1993 NFL Draft, selected by the Los Angeles Raiders, 60 picks ahead of teammate Mark Brunell. Hobert was the third quarterback selected in the draft, behind the top two overall picks, Drew Bledsoe and Rick Mirer. Hobert was also drafted in the 16th round (453rd overall) of the 1993 Major League Baseball Draft by the Chicago White Sox but choose to seek a career in the NFL. Hobert was a back-up quarterback for four seasons with the Raiders, then went on to play for the Buffalo Bills in 1997. He was initially expected to compete with Alex Van Pelt and Todd Collins for the starting quarterback position made vacant by Jim Kelly's retirement; however, after a notorious incident in Buffalo where he publicly admitted that he was unprepared to play, he was promptly released. He was acquired later that season by the New Orleans Saints, where he remained until 1999. The Saints traded him in 2000 to the Indianapolis Colts. While on the Colts roster for two years, he did not play a snap during the regular season.

VWillie \u201cThe Wisp\u201d Galimore (March 30, 1935 \u2013 July 27, 1964) was an American football running back for the Chicago Bears from 1957\u20131963. He attended Florida A&M University, working with the legendary coach Jake Gaither. Galimore is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame.Galimore possessed incredible speed and lateral movement; many of the opposing players of the time stated that they believed Galimore could run side-to-side down the field just as fast as most men could in a straight line. His running style could be said to most resemble the style of Billy Sims or perhaps Terrell Davis, but faster.In a documentary short by NFL Films on Galimore, it was said that he was probably the last great find before NFL scouting became sophisticated. Bears assistant coach Phil Handler, while scouting for talent in Florida, received a tip about Galimore's prowess as a halfback, and the Bears subsequently drafted him in the 5th round of the 1956 NFL draft. Galimore's peers (including Chuck Bednarik and Doug Atkins) referred to Galimore as one of the best runners they ever faced.Galimore was killed in an automobile accident on July 27, 1964 in Rensselaer, Indiana at the age of 29 with teammate Bo Farrington. His number 28 has been retired by the Bears.His son, Ron Galimore, was the first Black U.S. Olympic gymnast.Willie Galimore's last visit to his hometown of St. Augustine, Florida came just weeks before his death, and he participated in civil rights demonstrations there, becoming the first Black person who was able to register as a guest at the previously all-white Ponce de Leon Motor Lodge (where the arrest of the 72-year-old mother of the governor of Massachusetts for trying to be served in a racially integrated group had made national headlines a few months before). Galimore's civil rights activism is honored with a Freedom Trail marker at his home at 57 Chapin Street in St. Augustine. His widow, Mrs. Audrey Galimore, took part in the dedication of the marker on July 2, 2007. A community center in the historic Lincolnville neighborhood of the city also bears Galimore's name, and he is depicted on a historical mural painted by schoolchildren on Washington Street.

VTony Terrell Hollings (born December 1, 1981 in Macon, Georgia) is a former American football running back. He was originally selected in the second round of the 2003 NFL Supplemental Draft out of Georgia Tech by the Houston Texans.Because of knee surgery when he was at Georgia Tech, Hollings went nearly a year between games, but he regained durability throughout his rookie season and showed promise. On September 21 against the Kansas City Chiefs, in his first non-special teams action, he tore off 41 yards on 7 carries. He wound up starting a game late in the '03 season. Ex-coach Dom Capers said Hollings gave the team \u201csome speed and burst\u201d. Hollings was given the nickname "Superman" during his college career because of the way he "flew" over defensive opponents.In 2008 he played for the Dresden Monarchs in the German Football League as starting Halfback. One year later he was traded to the Berlin Adler but suffered a season-ending injury.

The Aztecs had a lackluster record during those years and Governali was succeeded by Don Coryell, who led them to their best years.Governali was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1986.Paul Governali also had a minor stint as an actor, portraying a professional football player in the 1948 movie titled, "Triple Threat."Paul Governali was married to Edna Governali with whom they had 4 children: Paul, Jeannie, Nicole, and Sam.

In 2003, Bernardo Harris was placed on the injured reserved and subsequently retired.Significant Contributions To the NFLWhile Bernardo Harris was playing for the Green Bay Packers in the January 3, 1999 playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers, Harris caused a controversial fumble which would largely be recognized as the precursor to video replay in the NFL.Towards the end of the 1999 playoff game, a pass was caught by Hall of Fame wide-receiver Jerry Rice, following the catch, Bernardo Harris stripped Jerry Rice of the ball, and was recovered by the Green Bay Packers. The game appeared to be won by the Green Bay Packers. However, the call on the field was that Rice was down by contact and San Francisco retained possession. Video replay showed that Rice has fumbled the ball, however, at that time replay was not used in the NFL. The 49ers went on to defeat the Green Bay Packers on that drive, by a final score of 30-27. Due to the controversial Harris call, the NFL announced the following season that it would begin instituting video replay.

VLurtis Pryor "Tommy" Thompson (August 15, 1916 \u2013 April 22, 1989) was an American football quarterback in the National Football League and Canadian Football League. He was blind in one eye, from a childhood incident, but nevertheless served in the U.S. Army for two years during World War II, which put his professional career on hold.Born in Hutchinson, Kansas, Thompson graduated from R. L. Paschal High School in Fort Worth, Texas, and played college football at the University of Tulsa.Thompson was an off-and-on starter for the Philadelphia Eagles, and led them to three consecutive NFL championship appearances, including the 1948 and 1949 title-winning seasons. His 25 touchdown passes led the league in 1948 and he led to victory in the championship game over the defending champion Chicago Cardinals in a snowstorm, avenging their loss in the previous year. Thompson also played on in the Canadian Football League for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in 1953.Thompson is one of three inactive NFL quarterbacks with multiple championships who were not inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, along with Jim Plunkett and Jack Kemp. Ray Didinger of CSNPhilly ranked him in the Top 5 all-time Eagles quarterbacks, citing his contribution to the championship teams. It is projected under the Harlor Formula that Thompson would have made 4 Pro Bowls.Thompson battled brain cancer for over a year and died in 1989 in Calico Rock, Arkansas.

VOliver Monroe "Ollie" Cline (December 31, 1925 \u2013 May 12, 2001) was a college and professional American football fullback who played for the Ohio State Buckeyes, Cleveland Browns and Detroit Lions in the 1940s and 1950s. A standout high school athlete in his hometown of Fredericktown, Ohio, Cline attended Ohio State University starting in 1944. He became the football team's primary fullback that year as the school went unbeaten and was ranked second in the nation in the AP Poll. The following year, Cline was named the most valuable player in the Big Ten Conference, rushing for 936 yards as Ohio State built up a 7\u20132 record and was ranked 12th in the AP Poll. Following a brief stint in the U.S. Army at the end of World War II, Cline returned to Ohio State for a final season in 1947.Cline began his professional career by signing with the Browns, a team in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) coached by former Ohio State head coach Paul Brown. Cleveland won all of its games and the AAFC championship in 1948 while Cline served as a backup to fullback Marion Motley. Cleveland traded Cline to the Buffalo Bills, where he spent the 1949 season, and joined the Lions in 1950 when the AAFC folded. The Lions won the NFL Championship Game in 1952 and 1953, beating the Browns both times. Cline then retired from football and earned a master's degree in education. He later worked at a variety of school systems in Ohio and Arizona. Cline was inducted into the Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame and was named to the Ohio State Football All-Century Team in 2000. He died in 2001.

VRonald Dixon (born May 28, 1976 in Wildwood, Florida) is a former American football wide receiver for the New York Giants in the National Football League. His most notable performance was his 97 yard kick return for a touchdown in Super Bowl XXXV. Dixon's return was the only score for the Giants as they went on to lose to the Baltimore Ravens 34-7. He also recorded a 97-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in the Giants win over the Philadelphia Eagles in the Divisional playoffs that year. As a result, he holds the record for the most kickoff returns for a touchdown in a postseason campaign (2).Dixon's career was once promising but was prematurely ended by a PCL injury in his left knee.Ron had try outs with the Miami Dolphins and the New Orleans Saints in the spring of 2005, but his knee injury was not healed enough for him to be effective, so he officially retired from the NFL as a vested veteran in 2005.Dixon has now moved to Orlando, Florida where he is a health insurance agent and the Director of Public Relations for the Tenncom Group, an insurance agency and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) brokerage. He is now in the process of developing a health/disability insurance program for athletes to insure against career ending injuries.Ron Dixon was once an intern on the Shannon Burke Show which aired on Real Radio in Orlando Florida. He also coached at Olympia High School. Dixon is an alumnus of Wildwood High School.

Edgar Hoover's administrative assistant and as a special agent for the Bureau, and during his crime-fighting career, served in the New York City, Detroit and Chicago field offices.In 1952, Gunsel was hired by the NFL to head the league's investigative department, a move made in response to commissioner Bert Bell's fear of a scandal damaging the league's image. Gunsel became league treasurer in 1956, holding the post until his retirement ten years later. He served as acting president of the NFL after Bell's death in October 1959.In January 1960 at a meeting of NFL owners, he was the early frontrunner to get the commissioner's job, but Los Angeles Rams general manager Pete Rozelle was ultimately elected to the post on January 26 after 23 ballots.Gunsel died at Lankenau Hospital in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania.

VJames Robert "Bob" Kalsu (April 13, 1945 \u2013 July 21, 1970) was an All-American tackle at the University of Oklahoma and an eighth-round selection in the 1968 NFL/AFL draft by the Buffalo Bills of the American Football League.Kalsu was a starting guard for the Bills in 1968. He played the entire season and was the Bills' team rookie-of-the-year. Following the 1968 season, to satisfy his Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) obligation, he entered the U.S. Army as a second lieutenant and arrived in Vietnam in November 1969 as part of the 101st Airborne Division. He was killed in action on July 21, 1970, when his unit came under enemy mortar fire at FSB Ripcord near the A Shau Valley. His family, out of respect, refused to talk in detail about the circumstances surrounding his death.When he had left for Vietnam, Lieutenant Kalsu had to say goodbye to his wife, Jan, and his daughter Jill. On July 23, 1970, two days after his death, Jan Kalsu gave birth to his son, James Robert Kalsu Jr, at the Kalsu home in Oklahoma City.
