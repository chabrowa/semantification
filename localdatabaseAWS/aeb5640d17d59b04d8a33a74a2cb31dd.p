VThe Kampfmesser 42 was a German made dual purpose combat knife. It was issued to the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS and was used throughout the Second World War. It was designed to be used as both a fighting knife and bayonet. This specific bayonet was longer than the usual bayonet on rifles, and was commonly used as a hand weapon. It was sometimes used as a throwing weapon.

VThe Mercedes-Benz M276 engine is a direct injected, V6 gasoline automotive piston engine.The M276 engine is related to the Chrysler Pentastar V6 engine, with which it shares its basic architecture, as it was developed while Chrysler was still owned by Daimler AG. This can be seen in its 60 degree vee-angle, as opposed to the 90 degree angle of its M272 predecessor. The 60 degree vee-angle eliminates the need for a balance shaft, improving refinement while reducing mechanical complexity.The M276 engine features an aluminum engine block and dual overhead camshafts with independent variable valve timing on intake and exhaust valves and a new timing chain arrangement. The M276 also includes direct injection with piezo-electrically controlled injectors for more precise fuel delivery, multi-spark ignition that allows for multiple ignition events during the combustion stroke, and modified accessories (such as the fuel pump, water pump, oil pump, and alternator) that reduce parasitic loads. These features are also shared with Mercedes' M278 V8 engine, announced at the same time.Mercedes-Benz claim that the new engine, in conjunction with vehicle modifications such as a stop-start system, can produce up to a 24% improvement in fuel economy while increasing power and torque over the M272.The M276 is not available in Australian market due to high sulphur content in the fuel. BMW had similar decision with their N53 engine for the same reason.

VThe T24 machine gun was a copy of the MG 42 developed during World War II as a possible replacement for the Browning Automatic Rifle & M1919A4 for infantry squads, the new version being adapted for the .30-06 cartridge. Saginaw Steering Gear constructed a working prototype designated as the T24 machine gun which could also be used on an M2 Tripod. However, the realization that the .30-06 cartridge might be too long for the gun's mechanism to easily cope with, and most notably a design flaw in the prototype resulted in the discarding of the project.

VThe D-400 series engine or the Iron Horse engine was a light-duty two-stroke engine used for powering lawnmowers produced in the 1960s to the early 1980s. D-400 engines were single-cylinder engines designed and manufactured by the Outboard Marine Corporation (OMC; Johnson and Evinrude) for Lawn-Boy and Masport. The D-400 engines displaced 109 cc, generated 2.61 kW of power, and operated in the range of 2400-3300 RPM. The engines have a distinctive rectangular cowling that has created a nickname of Brick-top mowers. Another distinctive feature is the two-finger vertical recoil starter. The kidney-shaped muffler and exhaust unit is mounted beneath the mowers' deck and gives the engine a small, low profile design when compared to the newer and more powerful lawnmower engines. The ignition system employs a magneto, points, and a condenser (capacitor) set-up with an unusual spark-advance system which utilised a weight on the crankshaft to adjust the spark-advance amount depending on engine speed. The sprung governor was also unusual with a throw-yoke which operated under the flywheel and was linked to the throttle. The carburettor was a float design and fed into a pair of reed valves.The D-400 engines are now a popular engine restoration job due to their distinctive shape and low cost. Parts, however can be difficult to source and therefore multiple engines are often bought to satisfy part requirements. The recommended oil:fuel mix is either 16:1 or 32:1 depending on age. In New Zealand and Australia, Masport offered the D-400 engine on their Premier, Premier II, Rancher, Rotacut, and Tornado models. In this Oceania market, the D-400 was called the Iron Horse engine.

VThe HTC Butterfly is an Android-based, 4G LTE-capable smartphone designed and developed by HTC. First announced for release in Japan by Japanese carrier KDDI as the HTC J Butterfly (HTL21), the J Butterfly was released in Japan on 9 December 2012 as the successor to the HTC J. Outside Japan, in other Asian countries, the phone was released as the HTC Butterfly (X920d) and in China and Russia as the HTC Butterfly (X920e). The Chinese/Russian and US versions of the Butterfly do not have a microSD slot. In the United States, the Butterfly was released as the HTC Droid DNA as a Verizon exclusive, supporting wireless charging. The DNA would become Verizon's final non-Motorola Droid smartphone; following its replacement in August 2013 by the HTC One and Droid Maxx, the carrier announced that all future Droid phones would be built exclusively by Motorola. In June 2013, the Butterfly was succeeded by the HTC Butterfly S.It is the second smartphone in the world to be announced with a 1080p display, after Oppo's Find 5, and the first phone to be released with one. The phone has Android version 4.1, a quad-core 1.5 GHz Snapdragon S4 Pro processor, an 8-megapixel rear camera, and a 2.1-megapixel front camera. It comes with 2 GB of RAM and a 2020 mAh battery.The Butterfly is water resistant with an IP rating of X5 and has a 5-inch "Super LCD 3" display with full HD resolution (1920x1080 pixels). This translates to a pixel density of 440 ppi. In comparison, The HTC One X offers 312 ppi. The Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX HD (HD has 720p display) at 312ppi, the iPhone 5's "Retina display", 326 ppi, and the Nokia Lumia 920, 332 ppi. The display is manufactured by Sharp, JDI.In India it was launched at a price of 44,900 rupees, making it the most expensive Android smartphone ever. But after the launch of Vertu Ti for 600,000 rupees, it does not hold that title anymore.In summer of 2013, the Butterfly was succeeded by the HTC Butterfly S in Asia. The Butterfly s was never released in Japan. The J Butterfly was succeeded by a phone of the same name in summer of 2014, later released as the Butterfly 2 in other Asian markets.

VHelios Bars are smart bicycle handlebars which integrate GPS tracking, Bluetooth connectivity, and rear LEDs that function like turn signals on a car. The device is made by Helios Biking, a hardware start-up based in San Francisco, California. The handlebars can be remotely controlled via a smartphone app when connected to a Bluetooth Low Energy (4.0) enabled smartphone. This allows them to be switched between a visual speedometer mode where the rear LEDs change color based on your speed, and a turn-by-turn navigation mode where the rear LEDs guide you to a destination by blinking left or right when a turn is approaching. Additionally, turn signals, or "blinkers," can be activated by pressing a tactile button on either side of the stem.

VThe M19 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage (MGMC) was a World War II United States Army self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon on the M24 light tank chassis. It was equipped with two Bofors 40 mm (1.6 in) guns. It was produced by Cadillac near the end of 1944.The M19 was developed from the T65 which was based on the M5 light tank chassis. The original design was improved upon and designated the T65E1. It was accepted into service in May 1944 as the M19 MGMC, equipping several U.S. Army anti-aircraft units during World War II. The M19A1 was an improved variant with an auxiliary engine and spare barrels for the 40 mm Bofors guns.During World War II, the M19 and M19A1 saw action in the European Theater of Operations as an assault gun, since the Allies had air supremacy over the skies of Europe. The M19 and M19A1 were also used during the Korean War in the same role.

VThe Colt SSP (Stainless Steel Pistol) was a prototype weapon produced by the Colt's Manufacturing Company to compete in the XM9 Handgun Trial, which was conducted by the US military's Joint Service Small Arms Program. This program to select a new standard-issue handgun for American armed forces took place over several years and was run a total of three times, ultimately being won by a variant of the Beretta 92 pistol.The SSP was a variant of the Colt Model 1971, an earlier attempt to develop a new service pistol to replace the M1911, with some minor mechanical alterations made for the trials.The trial's requirement was for each manufacturer who was interested in obtaining a contract for 325,000 handguns to submit 30 examples of their proposal for testing. Colt submitted 30 new SSPs out of a production run of around 50, but their pistol was not selected.

VThe Acorn Archimedes is a family of personal computers designed by Acorn Computers Ltd in Cambridge, England and sold in the late-1980s to mid-1990s, their first general purpose home computer based on their own ARM architecture (then the CPU and architecture was known as Acorn RISC Machine, or ARM, that later became one of the most widely used CPU architectures in the world, e.g. used in most smartphones). The first Archimedes was launched in 1987.ARM's RISC design \u2013 32-bit CPU (26-bit addressing), running at 8 MHz, was stated as running at 4.5+ MIPS, which provided a significant upgrade from 8-bit home computers, such as Acorn's previous ones. Claims of being the fastest micro in the world and running at 18 MIPS were also made during tests.The models in the family either omitted the Acorn or Archimedes part of the name, with the first models named "BBC Archimedes", while the name "Acorn Archimedes" is commonly used to describe any of Acorn's contemporary designs based on the same architecture. While the computers are no longer sold, computers such as the Raspberry Pi can still run its operating system, RISC OS (at least later versions) as they use ARM chips that are (mostly) compatible.

VThe Acorn Atom is a home computer made by Acorn Computers Ltd from 1980 to 1982, when it was replaced by the BBC Micro (originally Proton).The Atom was a progression of the MOS Technology 6502-based machines that the company had been making from 1979. The Atom was a cut-down Acorn System 3 without a disk drive but with an integral keyboard and cassette tape interface, sold in either kit or complete form. In 1980 it was priced between £120 in kit form, £170 ready assembled, to over £200 for the fully expanded version with 12 KB of RAM and the floating point extension ROM.The minimum Atom had 2 KB of RAM and 8 KB of ROM, with the maximum specification machine having 12 KB of each. An additional floating point ROM was also available. The 12 KB of RAM was divided between 1 KB for the zero page, 5 KB available for programs, and 6 KB for the high resolution graphics. The zero page was used by the CPU for stack storage, by the OS, and by the Atom BASIC for storage of the 27 variables. If high resolution graphics were not required then 5½ KB of the upper memory could be used for program storage.It had an MC6847 Video Display Generator (VDG) video chip, allowing for both text and graphics modes. It could be connected to a TV or modified to output to a video monitor. Basic video memory was 1 KB but could be expanded to 6 KB. Since the MC6847 could only output at 60 Hz, meaning that the video could not be resolved on a large proportion of European TV sets, a 50 Hz PAL colour card was later made available. Six video modes were available, with resolutions from 64×64 in 4 colours, up to 256×192 in monochrome. At the time, 256×192 was considered to be high resolution.It had built-in BASIC (Atom BASIC), a fast but idiosyncratic version, which included indirection operators (similar to PEEK and POKE) for bytes and words (of 4 bytes each). Assembly code could be included within a BASIC program, because the BASIC interpreter also contained an assembler for the 6502 assembly language which assembled the inline code during program execution and then executed it. This was a very unusual, but also very useful, function.In late 1982, Acorn released an upgrade ROM chip for the Atom which allowed users to switch between Atom BASIC and the more advanced BASIC used by the BBC Micro. The upgrade was purely to the programming language; the Atom's graphics and sound capabilities remained unchanged, and hence, contrary to some pre-release beliefs, the BBC BASIC ROM did not allow Atom users to run commercial BBC Micro software, since nearly all of it took advantage of the BBC machine's advanced graphics and sound hardware.The manual for the Atom was called Atomic Theory and Practice and was written by David Johnson-Davies, subsequently Managing Director of Acornsoft.The Acorn LAN, Econet, was first configured on the Atom.The case was designed by industrial designer Allen Boothroyd of Cambridge Product Design Ltd.

VThe Acorn Network Computer was a network computer (a type of thin client) designed and manufactured by Acorn Computers Ltd. It was the implementation of the Network Computer Reference Profile that Oracle Corporation commissioned Acorn to specify for network computers (for more detail on the history, see Acorn's Network Computer). Sophie Wilson of Acorn led the effort. It was launched in August 1996.The NCOS operating system used in this first implementation was based on RISC OS and ran on ARM hardware. Manufacturing obligations were achieved through a contract with Fujitsu subsidiary D2D.In 1997, Acorn offered its designs at no cost to licensees of RISC OS.

VThe Acorn System 1, initially called the Acorn Microcomputer (Micro-Computer), was an early 8-bit microcomputer for hobbyists, based on the MOS 6502 CPU, and produced by British company Acorn Computers from 1979.The main parts of the system were designed by then-Cambridge-undergraduate student Sophie Wilson., with a cassette interface design by Steve Furber. It was Acorn's first product, and was based on an automated cow feeder.It was a small machine built on two Eurocard-standard circuit boards and it could be purchased ready-built or in kit form.one card (shown right) with the I/O part of the computer: a LED seven segment display, a 25-key keypad (hex+function keys), and a cassette CUTS interface (the circuitry to the left of the keypad)the second card (the computer board - see below), which included the CPU, RAM/ROM memory, and support chipsthe two boards were interconnected by a semi-flexible, multi-conductor cable, known by its commercial name 'Spectra Strip'the whole assembly was held together by four 2.5mm × 20mm nylon screws and clear plastic spacing tubes for rigidity.Main Components (left to right)Top Row: INS8154 RAMIO Integrated Circuit (for keyboard and display), 6502 CPU, 2 × 2114 1024×4 RAM, 2 × 74S571 512×4 PROM, RAM/ROM expansion socket, second INS8154 for peripheral expansion (optional extra with the kit version).Bottom row: 1 MHz clock crystal, 4 × TTL logic chips providing address decoding for the memory and I/O expansion, 5V regulator.The smaller empty socket in the middle of the board was used to set the memory map of the RAM, ROM and I/O expansion by fitting or soldering wires between various positions according to the instructions in the Acorn System 1 Technical Manual.The three semi-circular legends on the bottom left of the board marked positions for optional push switches to trigger the board's RESET, IRQ (Interrupt ReQuest) and NMI (Non Maskable Interrupt) lines.Almost all CPU signals were accessible via the standard Eurocard connector on the right-hand side of the board. This connector was not fitted/supplied as standard with the kit version.

VThe BBC Microcomputer System, or BBC Micro, is a series of microcomputers and associated peripherals designed and built by the Acorn Computer company for the BBC Computer Literacy Project, operated by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Designed with an emphasis on education, it was notable for its ruggedness, expandability, and the quality of its operating system.After the Literacy Project's call for bids for a computer to accompany the TV programmes and literature, Acorn won the contract with the Proton, a successor of its Atom computer prototyped at short notice. Renamed the BBC Micro, the system was adopted by most schools in the United Kingdom, changing Acorn's fortunes. It was also moderately successful as a home computer in the UK despite its high cost. Acorn also employed the machine to simulate and develop the ARM architecture which, many years later, has become hugely successful for embedded systems, including tablets and cellphones. In 2013 ARM was the most widely used 32-bit instruction set architecture.While nine models were eventually produced with the BBC brand, the phrase "BBC Micro" is usually used colloquially to refer to the first six (Model A, B, B+64, B+128, Master 128, and Master Compact), excluding the Acorn Electron; subsequent BBC models are considered as part of Acorn's Archimedes series.

VThe Magnavox Odyssey is the first commercial home video game console. It was developed by a small team led by Ralph H. Baer at Sanders Associates and released by Magnavox in the United States in September 1972 and overseas the following year. The Odyssey consists of a white, black, and brown box which connects to a television set and two rectangular controllers attached by wires. It is capable of displaying three square dots on the screen in monochrome black and white, with different behavior of the dots depending on the game played, and has no sound capabilities. Players place plastic overlays on the screen to create visuals, and the one or two players for each game control their dots with the three knobs and one button on the controller in accordance with the rules given for the game. The Odyssey console came packaged with dice, paper money, and other board game paraphernalia to go along with the games, and a peripheral controller\u2014the first video game light gun\u2014was sold separately.The idea for a video game console was thought up by Baer in August 1966, and over the next three years he, along with Bill Harrison and Bill Rusch, created seven successive prototype consoles. The seventh, known as the Brown Box, was shown to several manufacturers before Magnavox agreed to produce it in January 1971. After releasing the console in September 1972 through their dealerships, Magnavox sold between 69,000 and 100,000 units by the end of the year, and 350,000 by the time the console was discontinued in 1975. The console spawned the Magnavox Odyssey series of dedicated consoles, as well as the 1978 Magnavox Odyssey². One of the 28 games made for the system, a ping pong game, was an inspiration for Atari's successful Pong arcade game, in turn driving sales of the console. Baer's patents for the console and the games, including what was termed by a judge as "the pioneering patent of the video game art", formed the basis of a series of lawsuits over 20 years, earning Sanders and Magnavox over US$100 million. The release of the Odyssey marked the end of the early history of video games, and the rise of the commercial video game industry along with the start of the first generation of video game consoles.

VThe Xerox Alto was the first computer designed from the start to support an operating system based on a graphical user interface (GUI), later using the desktop metaphor. The first machines were introduced on 1 March 1973, a decade before mass market GUI machines arose.The Alto uses a custom multi-chip central processing unit (CPU) filling a small cabinet, and each machine cost tens of thousands of dollars despite being intended to be used as a personal computer. Only small numbers were built initially, but by the late 1970s about 1,000 were in use at various Xerox labs, and about another 500 in several universities. Total production was about 2,000 systems.The Alto became well known in Silicon Valley and its GUI was increasingly seen as the future of computing. In 1979, Steve Jobs arranged a deal in which Apple Computer would license the concepts from Xerox in exchange for Xerox being able to purchase stock options in Apple. After two famous visits to see the Alto, Apple engineers used the concepts to introduce the Apple Lisa and Macintosh systems, sparking the GUI revolution that took hold during the 1980s.Xerox eventually commercialized a heavily modified version of the Alto concepts as the Xerox Star, first introduced in 1981. A complete office system including several workstations, storage and a laser printer cost as much as $100,000, and like the Alto, the Star had little direct impact on the market.

The console was based on the Apple Pippin platform \u2013 a derivative of the Apple Macintosh platform. Bandai produced the ATMARK and @WORLD consoles between 1996 and 1997.The goal of the Bandai Pippin was to create an inexpensive computer aimed mostly at playing CD-based multimedia software, especially games, but also functioning as a thin client. The operating system was basically a stripped version of System 7.5.2, and was based on a 66 MHz PowerPC 603 processor and a 14.4 kb/s modem. It featured a 4×-speed CD-ROM drive and a video output that could connect to a standard television display.

VThe Apple Pippin is an open platform, multimedia technology platform, designed by Apple Computer, and marketed as PiPP!N. According to Apple, Pippin was directed at the home market as "an integral part of the consumer audiovisual, stereo, and television environment."Pippin is based on the Apple Macintosh platform, including the classic Mac OS architecture. Apple built a demonstration device based on Pippin called "Pippin Power Player," and used it to demonstrate the platform at trade shows and to the media, in order to attract potential software developers and hardware manufacturers. Apple licensed the Pippin technology to third-party companies. Bandai Company Ltd. developed the ATMARK and @WORLD models, and focused them on the gaming and entertainment business in Japan and the United States. Katz Media developed the KMP 2000, and focused it on vertical markets throughout Europe and Canada.

VThe A9home is a niche small-form-factor desktop computer running RISC OS Adjust32. It was officially unveiled at the 2005 Wakefield Show, and is the second commercial ARM-based RISC OS computer to run a 32-bit version of RISC OS. When the Iyonix was withdrawn from sale, the A9home remained the only hardware to be manufactured specifically for the RISC OS marketplace.It is smaller than the Mac mini and housed in cobalt-blue aluminium casing, measuring 168 mm × 103 mm × 53 mm in size. The machine runs on a 400 MHz Samsung ARM9 processor, has 128 MB SDRAM of main memory and 8 MB VRAM and houses an internal hard disk of 40 GB. On the front, it features two USB 1.1 ports, a microphone and a headphones socket. On the rear, it has two USB 1.1 ports, two PS/2 ports, 10/100 BaseT network port, a RS-232 serial port and a power connection socket. Like the Mac mini, it is powered by an external PSU (5 V, 20 W). Furthermore, it has a power/reset switch, a status/health indicator and a drive activity indicator LED. The A9home is not designed to be internally expanded.The A9home can use a program called Aemulor to emulate older 26-bit applications. This was originally developed for Castle's Iyonix PC.In April 2006, Advantage Six Ltd announced that they were focussing on connectivity in the run-up to that year's Wakefield Show. At the show, they demonstrated integrated bluetooth. Although the A9home has been officially released for purchase by end-users, its custom version of RISC OS 4 remains unfinished. As of 2013, RISCOS Ltd has closed after failing to release any information in 2012 about when or if the OS will become feature complete.

VThe M4 Sherman, officially Medium Tank, M4, was the most numerous battle tank used by the United States and some of the other Western Allies in World War II. The M4 Sherman proved to be reliable, relatively cheap to produce and available in great numbers. Thousands were distributed through the Lend-Lease program to the British Commonwealth and Soviet Union. The tank was named by the British for the American Civil War General William Tecumseh Sherman.The M4 Sherman evolved from the interim M3 Medium Tank, which had its main armament in a side sponson mount. The M4 retained much of the previous mechanical design but put the main 75 mm gun in a fully traversing turret. One feature, a one-axis gyrostabilizer, was not precise enough to allow firing when moving but did help keep the reticle on target, so that when the tank did stop to fire, the gun would be aimed in roughly the right direction. The designers stressed mechanical reliability, ease of production and maintenance, durability, standardization of parts and ammunition in a limited number of variants, and moderate size and weight. These factors, combined with the Sherman's then-superior armor and armament, outclassed German light and medium tanks of 1939\u201342. The M4 went on to be produced in large numbers. It spearheaded many offensives by the Western Allies after 1942.When the M4 tank went into combat in North Africa with the British Army at El Alamein in the autumn of 1942, it increased the advantage of Allied armor over German armor and was superior to the lighter German long-barrel 50 mm-gunned Panzer III and the short-barrel 75 mm-gunned Panzer IV then in service. For this reason, the US Army believed the M4 would be adequate to win the war, and no pressure was exerted for further tank development. Logistical and transport restrictions, such as limitations imposed by roads, ports, and bridges, also complicated the introduction of a more capable but heavier tank. Tank destroyer battalions using vehicles built on the M4 hull and chassis, but with open-topped turrets and more potent high-velocity guns, also entered widespread use in the American army. Even by 1944, most M4 Shermans kept their dual purpose 75 mm M3. By 1944 and 1945, the M4 was inferior to German heavy tanks but was able to fight on with mutual support from numerical superiority and with support from growing numbers of fighter-bombers and artillery pieces.The relative ease of production allowed huge numbers of the M4 to be manufactured, and significant investment in tank recovery and repair units allowed disabled vehicles to be repaired and returned to service. These factors combined to give the Americans numerical superiority in most battles, and many infantry divisions were provided with M4s and tank destroyers. A M4A3E8 variant was introduced, with improved suspension and a high-velocity 76 mm gun as used on the tank destroyers.After World War II, the Sherman, often in updated versions, saw combat in many conflicts, including the Korean War, the Arab-Israeli Wars, and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.

VThe RiscPC (stylised with a half-space as Risc\u2009PC, also referred to as Risc PC and codenamed Medusa) was Acorn Computers's next generation RISC OS/Acorn RISC Machine computer, launched on 15 April 1994, which superseded the Acorn Archimedes. The Acorn PC card and software allows PC compatible software to be run.Like the Archimedes, the RiscPC continued the practice of having the RISC OS operating system in a ROM module. RiscPC augmented the ROM-based core OS with a disk-based directory structure containing configuration information, and some applications which had previously been kept in ROM. At the 1996 BETT Educational Computing & Technology Awards, the machine was awarded Gold in the hardware category.

VTiger I  listen  was a German heavy tank of World War II deployed from 1942 in Africa and Europe usually in independent heavy tank battalions. Its final designation was Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger Ausf. E often shortened to Tiger. The Tiger I gave the Wehrmacht its first armoured fighting vehicle that mounted the KwK 36 88-mm gun (not to be confused with the 8.8 cm Flak 36). Only 1,347 were built between August 1942 and August 1944. Production was phased out in favour of the Tiger II.While the Tiger I has been called an outstanding design for its time, it was over-engineered, using expensive materials and labour-intensive production methods. The Tiger was prone to certain types of track failures and breakdowns, and was limited in range by its high fuel consumption. It was expensive to maintain, but generally mechanically reliable. It was also difficult to transport, and vulnerable to immobilization when mud, ice and snow froze between its overlapping and interleaved Schachtellaufwerk-pattern road wheels, often jamming them solid. This was a problem on the Eastern Front in the muddy rasputitsa season and during extreme periods of cold.The tank was given its nickname "Tiger" by Ferdinand Porsche, and the Roman numeral was added after the later Tiger II entered production. The initial designation was Panzerkampfwagen VI Ausführung H (\u2018\u2018Panzer VI version H\u2019\u2019, abbreviated PzKpfw VI Ausf. H) where 'H' denoted Henschel as the designer/manufacturer. It was classed with ordnance inventory designation SdKfz 182. The tank was later redesignated as PzKpfw VI Ausf. E in March 1943, with ordnance inventory designation SdKfz 181.Today, only a handful of Tigers survive in museums and exhibitions worldwide. The Bovington Tank Museum's Tiger 131 is currently the only one restored to running order.

VThe chakram (Devan\u0101gar\u012b: \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0930\u0902; Punjabi: chakkar; Malay: cakeram) is a throwing weapon from India. It is circular in shape with a sharpened outer edge and ranges in size from approximately 12\u201330 centimetres (4.7\u201311.8 in) in diameter. It is also known as chalikar\u200c meaning "circle", and was sometimes referred to in English writings as a "war-quoit". The chakram is primarily a throwing weapon but can also be used hand-to-hand. A smaller variant called chakri was worn on the wrist. A related weapon is the chakri dang, a bamboo staff with a chakri attached at one end.

VThe gada (Sanskrit: \u0917\u0926\u093e gad\u0101, Malay: gedak) is a blunt mace or club from India. Made either of wood or metal, it consists essentially of a spherical head mounted on a shaft, with a spike on the top. Outside India, the gada was also adopted in Southeast Asia, where it is still used in silat.The gada is the main weapon of the Hindu god Hanuman. Known for his strength, Hanuman is traditionally worshipped by wrestlers in South and Southeast Asia. Vishnu also carries a gada named Kaumodaki in one of his four hands. In the Mahabharata epic, the fighters Bhima, Duryodhana, Jarasandha, Balarama and others were said to be masters of the gada.

It was the last Game Boy-based add-on to a Nintendo console. It connects via the high speed parallel port at the bottom of the GameCube and requires use of a boot disc to access the hardware. Unlike devices such as Datel's Advance Game Port, the Game Boy Player does not use software emulation, but instead uses physical hardware nearly identical to that of a Game Boy Advance.

More than two dozen arcade titles were released for CPS-1, before Capcom shifted game development over to its successor, the CP System II.Capcom's Street Fighter II series is perhaps the best known franchise within the CPS game library. The first three titles in the series (The World Warrior, Champion Edition and Hyper Fighting) were all developed on CPS-1 and highly successful.

It is closely related to the Ford Essex V4 engine produced in displacements of 1.7 L and 2.0 L. Both engines share many parts since the Essex V6 was directly derived from the Essex V4, the 2.0 L Essex V4 and the 3.0 L Essex V6 in fact have exactly the same bore and stroke and share various components.

The name "Pentagon" derives from the shape of the original PCB (Pentagon 48), with a diagonal cut in one of the corners. Many simple devices (upgrades) were invented to connect to the Pentagon with a soldering iron.

VTheVulcan FlipStart was a super compact PC, weighing 1.5 pounds (with standard high capacity battery) and the size of a paperback novel (4.5 by 5.9 by 1.6 inches with high capacity battery). FlipStart was the release name for the concept PC Paul Allen showed at CES 2003 and 2004, specifically FlipStart V1.0. The original concept name was Mini-PC.Its main competition at the time of release was the Ogo Model 02. Ogo had released the Model 1 at the time the FlipStart was announced 4 years earlier. They were both equipped with QWERTY keyboards and wireless capabilities but the FlipStart was a clamshell (flipped open) versus the Ogo which slid up to reveal the keyboard.

VThe PlayStation Eye (trademarked PLAYSTATION Eye) is a digital camera device, similar to a webcam, for the PlayStation 3. The technology uses computer vision and gesture recognition to process images taken by the camera. This allows players to interact with games using motion and color detection as well as sound through its built-in microphone array. It is the successor to the EyeToy for the PlayStation 2, which was released in 2003.The peripheral was launched in a bundle with The Eye of Judgment in the United States on October 23, 2007, in Japan and Australia on October 25, 2007 and in Europe on October 26, 2007.The PlayStation Eye was also released as a stand-alone product in United States, Europe, and Australia. EyeToy designer Richard Marks stated that the EyeToy was used as a model for the rough cost design. In 2013 Sony announced the PlayStation Eye will be replaced with the PlayStation Camera for the PlayStation 4 console to compete with Microsoft Corporation's Kinect and Nintendo's Wii Remote Plus.

VThe iMac G3 is a line of personal computers developed, manufactured, and sold by Apple Computer from 1998 to 2003. Noted for its innovative design via the use of translucent and brightly colored plastics, it was the first consumer-facing Apple product to debut under the recently returned interim CEO Steve Jobs. It was updated over time with new hardware and colors, until being supplanted by the iMac G4 and eMac in 2002.The iMac G3, among other factors, was responsible for Apple's turnaround from financial ruin in the late 1990s and revitalized the Apple brand as design-oriented and simple. It was, nevertheless, criticized for abandoning then-current technological standards like the floppy drive and the Apple Desktop Bus connector in favor of the emerging USB standard.

VThe Toshiba Satellite (dynabook Satellite in Japan) was a line of consumer-grade notebook computers marketed by Toshiba. Models in the Satellite family varied greatly - from entry-level models sold at major retailers to full-fledged media center-class notebooks. The latter are labeled as "Qosmio" and sold alongside the Satellite name.The Qosmio models tended to have added features like two hard drive bays, multiple graphics cards, a large number of input/output ports of varying design, unique case styling, backlit keyboards, significantly more powerful sound systems (built in subwoofer and amplifier), etc.The early models did not come with an internal CD-ROM drive, but these soon appeared as mobile technology progressed. Such models can link up with an external CD-ROM drive through the parallel port on the rear (since USB ports came later as well). Some Satellites also lacked an internal floppy disk drive, but a port on the side allowed the use of a proprietary external module for such. These machines tended to be smaller in physical size than their contemporaries.In Spring 2000, some models came with a 15 inch screen and a built-in DVD drive, a 6 GB HDD and ran at 500 MHz. They were sold for $2400 by Toshiba. They also had a model called the Satellite Pro. Newer models of the Satellite Pro are still being sold.The Toshiba Satellite appears to have been discontinued as of 2016, as there is no mention of it on the Toshiba website.

VThe Toshiba Satellite (dynabook Satellite in Japan) was a line of consumer-grade notebook computers marketed by Toshiba, and were some of the earliest laptops, introduced in the 1980's, to compete with the IBM Thinkpad line. Models in the Satellite family varied greatly - from entry-level models sold at major retailers to full-fledged media center-class notebooks. The latter are labeled as "Qosmio" and sold alongside the Satellite name.The Qosmio models tended to have added features like two hard drive bays, multiple graphics cards, a large number of input/output ports of varying design, unique case styling, backlit keyboards, significantly more powerful sound systems (built in subwoofer and amplifier), etc.The early models did not come with an internal CD-ROM drive, but these soon appeared as mobile technology progressed. Such models can link up with an external CD-ROM drive through the parallel port on the rear (since USB ports came later as well). Some Satellites also lacked an internal floppy disk drive, but a port on the side allowed the use of a proprietary external module for such. These machines tended to be smaller in physical size than their contemporaries.In Spring 2000, some models came with a 15 inch screen and a built-in DVD drive, a 6 GB HDD and ran at 500 MHz. They were sold for $2400 by Toshiba. They also had a model called the Satellite Pro. Newer models of the Satellite Pro are still being sold.The Toshiba Satellite series was discontinued in 2016 because Toshiba has exited the laptop market entirely.

VThe CVH (Compound Valve angle Hemispherical combustion chamber) engine was introduced by Ford in 1980 in the third generation European Ford Escort and for the 1981 North American Escort. It was later used in the Ford Sierra as well as the second generation Ford Fiesta and from 1983 it was used in the Ford Orion. Engines were built in the Dearborn Engine Plant for the North American market, and in Ford's then-new engine plant in Bridgend in Wales for the European market.The engine was originally conceived in 1974 and had a single overhead cam. Its valves were mounted at a compound angle in hemispherical combustion chambers, although some versions altered the combustion chamber shape to increase swirl. It also featured hydraulic valve lifters, a first for a European Ford engine. The engine was given different names throughout its production. From 1991 to 1996 in the Ford Escort, it was "1.9L SEFI"; and from 1997 to 2002, it was "Split Port Induction 2000". From 2000 to 2004 in the Ford Focus, it was "Split Port".Despite its considerable shortcomings in terms of Noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) and its intolerance of poor or neglected servicing, the CVH was regarded as being a very easy engine to tune, with many of its key components being considerably over-engineered. It wasn't long before the engine started receiving attention from the aftermarket tuning industry, and the 1.6 L version quickly became a stalwart of the tuning scene in the 1980s and 1990s with some significant increases in power output (over 200 bhp (150 kW)) being extracted from the turbocharged variants. The naturally aspirated 1.6 L was a popular choice for the kit car industry, where it could be relatively easily and cheaply tweaked to around 130 bhp (97 kW).The CVH was produced in many different capacities from 1.1 to 2.0 L, the smaller versions being exclusively for the European market.

VThe Personal System/2 or PS/2 was IBM's third generation of personal computers. Released in 1987, it officially replaced the IBM PC, XT, AT, and PC Convertible in IBM's lineup.The PS/2 line was created by IBM in an attempt to recapture control of the PC market by introducing an advanced yet proprietary architecture. IBM's considerable market presence plus the reliability of the PS/2 ensured that the systems would sell in relatively large numbers, especially to large businesses. However the other major manufacturers balked at IBM's licensing terms to develop and sell compatible hardware, particularly as the demanded royalties were on a per machine basis. Also the evolving Wintel architecture was seeing a period of dramatic reductions in price, and so these developments prevented the PS/2 from returning control of the PC market to IBM.However, many of the PS/2's innovations, such as the 16550 UART (serial port), 1.44 MB 3.5-inch floppy disk format, 72-pin SIMMs, the PS/2 keyboard and mouse ports, and the VGA video standard, went on to become standards in the broader PC market.The OS/2 operating system was announced at the same time as the PS/2 line and was intended to be the primary operating system for models with Intel 286 or later processors. However, at the time of the first shipments, only PC DOS was available. OS/2 1.0 (text-mode only) and Microsoft's Windows 2.0 became available several months later. IBM also released AIX PS/2, a UNIX operating system for PS/2 models with Intel 386 or later processors.

VThe Galaxy Nexus (GT-I9250) is a touchscreen Android smartphone co-developed by Google and Samsung Electronics. It is the third smartphone in the Google Nexus series, a family of Android consumer devices built by an original equipment manufacturer partner. The phone is the successor to Google's previous flagship phones, the Nexus One and Nexus S.The Galaxy Nexus has a high-definition (1280 × 720) Super AMOLED display with a Dragontrail curved glass surface, an improved camera, and was the first Android version 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich device. The name is the result of co-branding between the Samsung Galaxy and Google Nexus brands of Android smartphones. The device is known as the Galaxy X in Brazil, however, due to a trademark on the "Nexus" brand.The Galaxy Nexus was unveiled jointly by Google and Samsung on 19 October 2011 in Hong Kong. It was released in Europe on 17 November 2011. It is one of the few phones recommended by the Android Open Source Project for building Android from source. By 29 October 2012, the Galaxy Nexus was no longer available for sale on the Google Play Store, following the release of its successor, the LG Nexus 4.

VGoogle Nexus is a line of consumer electronic devices that run the Android operating system. Google manages the design, development, marketing, and support of these devices, but some development and all manufacturing are carried out by partnering with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). As of August 2016, the devices currently available in the line are two smartphones, the Nexus 6P (made with Huawei) and Nexus 5X (made with LG). The line has also included tablets and streaming media players, though neither type of device is currently available. The most recent tablet was the Nexus 9 (made with HTC), and the most recent streaming media player the Nexus Player (made with Asus).Devices in the Nexus line are considered Google's flagship Android products. They contain little to no manufacturer or wireless carrier modifications to Android (such as custom user interfaces), although devices sold through carriers are sometimes SIM locked and may bear some extra branding. Nexus 6 devices sold through AT&T, for example, are SIM locked and feature a custom boot splash screen and a logo on the back of the device, despite having otherwise identical hardware to the unlocked variant. The Verizon Galaxy Nexus featured a Verizon logo on the back and received software updates at a slower pace than the unlocked variant, though it featured different hardware to accommodate Verizon's CDMA network. All Nexus devices feature an unlockable bootloader to allow further development and end-user modification. Nexus devices are often among the first Android devices to receive updates to the operating system.

VNexus Q is a discontinued digital media player that was developed by Google. Unveiled at the Google I/O developers' conference on June 2012, the device was expected to be released to the public in the United States shortly thereafter for US$300. The Nexus Q was designed to leverage Google's online media offerings, such as Google Play Music, Google Play Movies & TV, and YouTube, to provide a "shared" experience. Users could stream content from the supported services to a connected television, or speakers connected to an integrated amplifier, using their Android device and the services' respective apps as a remote control for queueing content and controlling playback.The Nexus Q received mixed reviews from critics following its unveiling. While its unique spherical design was praised, the Q was criticized for its lack of functionality in comparison to similar devices such as Apple TV, including a lack of third-party content services, no support for streaming content directly from other devices using the DLNA standard, as well as other software issues that affected the usability of the device. The unclear market positioning of the Nexus Q was also criticized, as it carried a significantly higher price than competing media players with wider capabilities; The New York Times' technology columnist David Pogue characterized the device as being "wildly overbuilt" for its limited functions.The Nexus Q was given away at no cost to attendees of Google I/O 2012, but the product's consumer launch was postponed in July 2012, purportedly to collect additional feedback. Those who had pre-ordered the Nexus Q following its unveiling received the device at no cost. The Nexus Q was quietly shelved in January 2013, and support for the device in the Google Play apps was phased out beginning in May 2013. Some of the Nexus Q's concepts would be a later product known as Chromecast, which similarly allows users to wirelessly queue content for playback using functions found in supported apps.

VThe Ford 335 engine family was a group of small-block V8 engines built by the Ford Motor Company between 1969 (for the 1970 model year) and 1982. The significance of the numerals '335' designated to this series of Ford V8 engines came from Ford management who dictated 335 cu in be the original capacity with room for expansion during its development. This engine family began production in late 1969 with a 351 cu in (5.8 L) engine, commonly called the 351C. It later expanded to include a 400 cu in (6.6 L) engine which used a taller version of the engine block, commonly referred to as a tall deck engine block, a 351 cu in (5.8 L) tall deck variant, called the 351M and a 302 cu in (4.9 L) engine which was exclusive to Australia.The 351C, introduced in 1969 for 1970 model year, is commonly referred to as the 351Cleveland after the Cleveland Engine plant in which most of these engines were manufactured. This plant complex in Brookpark, Ohio, included a gray iron foundry (casting plant), a stamping plant, and an engine assembly plant. As newer automobile engines began incorporating aluminum blocks, Ford eventually closed the casting plant in May 2012. The 335 series engines were used in mid-sized and full-sized cars, as well as light trucks, (351M/400 only) at times concurrently with the larger member of the Windsor small-block family, the 351 Windsorin cars. These engines were also used as a replacement for the FE V8 family in both the car and truck lines. The 335 series V8 engines, only outliving the FE by a half-decade, were eventually abandoned in favor of the more compact Windsor V8 engines. Due mainly to the fact of more stringent emission controls, there was also dying consumer demand for engines in the 400 CID realm, with mopar and GM discontinueing theirs after 79. The 351M/lasted untill 1982 in the F Series trucks, before being replaced by the 351 windsor engine. The 400 was also dropped in 82 being unofficially replaced in 83 by the Navistar (International Harvester) 6.9L diesel, which was billed to fill the gap between the 351W and the 460.

VThe Ford "Windsor" engine is a series of automobile V8 engines built by the Ford Motor Company beginning in July 1961. The engine was discontinued in new vehicles in 2001, but remains available for purchase from Ford Racing and Performance Parts as a crate engine. The "Windsor" designation is a retroactive name for the family of engines sharing a common basic engine block design. Ford adopted the designation specifically to distinguish the 351 cu in (5.8 L) displacement version from the "Cleveland" 335-family engine of the same displacement.The engine was designed as a successor to the Ford Y-block engine. Production began in 1961 for installation in the 1962 model year Ford Fairlane and Mercury Meteor. Originally produced with a displacement of 221 cu in (3.6 L), it would eventually increase to a maximum displacement of 351 cu in (5.8 L), but was most commonly sold with a displacement of 302 cu in (4.9 L) (later marketed as "5.0 L"), with engines of that displacement offered from 1968 until 2000. From the mid-1970s through the 1990s, the "Windsor" engine was also marinized for use in smaller recreational boats.For the 1991 model year, Ford began phasing in their new 4.6/5.4 L Modular V8 engine, which was to replace the small block "Windsor". In 1996, Ford replaced the "5.0 L" (302 cu in) pushrod Windsor V8 with the Modular 4.6 L in the Mustang. Its use continued until 1997 in the F-150 pickup truck, until 2001 in the Explorer SUV, and until 2002 by Ford Australia in their Falcon and Fairlane cars.

VThe iMac is a range of all-in-one Macintosh desktop computers designed and built by Apple Inc. It has been the primary part of Apple's consumer desktop offerings since its debut in August 1998, and has evolved through six distinct forms.In its original form, the iMac G3 had a gumdrop or egg-shaped look, with a CRT monitor, mainly enclosed by a colored, translucent plastic case, which was refreshed early on with a sleeker design notable for its slot-loaded optical drive. The second major revision, the iMac G4, moved the design to a hemispherical base containing all the main components and an LCD monitor on a freely moving arm attached to it. The third and fourth major revisions, the iMac G5 and the Intel iMac respectively, placed all the components immediately behind the display, creating a slim unified design that tilts only up and down on a simple metal base. The fifth major revision (Summer 2007) shared the same form as the previous model, but was thinner and used anodized aluminum and a glass panel over the entire front. The sixth major revision (Fall 2012) uses a different display unit, omits the SuperDrive, and uses different production techniques from the older unibody versions. This allows it to be thinner at the edge than older models, with an edge thickness of 5.9mm (but the same maximum depth). It also includes a dual microphone setup, and includes solid-state drive (SSD) or hard disk storage, or an Apple Fusion Drive, a hybrid of solid state and hard disk drives. This version of the iMac was announced in October 2012, with the 21.5-inch (55 cm) version released in November and the 27-inch (69 cm) version in December; these were refreshed in September 2013, with new Haswell processors, faster graphics, faster and larger SSD options and 802.11ac WiFi cards.In October 2014, the seventh major revision of the 27-inch (69 cm) iMac was announced, whose main feature is a "Retina 5K" display at a resolution of 5120 x 2880 pixels. The new model also includes a new processor, graphics chip, and IO, along with several new storage options. The seventh major revision of the 21.5-inch (55 cm) iMac was announced in October 2015, its main feature a "Retina 4K" display at a resolution of 4096 x 2304 pixels. It has the same new processor, graphics chip, and IO as the 27 inch iMac, along with several new storage options.

VThe VQ is a V6 piston engine produced by Nissan with displacements varying from 2.0 L to 4.0 L. It is an aluminum block DOHC 4-valve (per cylinder) design with aluminum heads. It is fitted with Nissan's EGI/ECCS sequential multi-point fuel injection (MPFI) system. Later versions feature various implementations of variable valve timing and replace MPFI with direct fuel injection (marketed as NEO-Di). The VQ series engine was honored by Ward's 10 Best Engines list almost every year from the list's inception. The VQ series replaced the VG series of engines.

VThe Rafael Python is a family of air-to-air missiles (AAMs) built by the Israeli weapons manufacturer Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, formerly RAFAEL Armament Development Authority. Originally starting with the Shafrir (Hebrew: \u05e9\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05e8\u200e\u200e, loosely translated as Dragonfly, a male form of inflection for Damselfly (\u05e9\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea)) series, the Shafrir-1 missile was developed in 1959, followed by the Shafrir-2 in early 1970s. Subsequently, the missiles were given the western name of "Python" by the parent company for export purposes, starting with the Python-3 in 1978. Since then, it has been further developed and evolved into the Python-4, Python-5, Derby and also, the SPYDER, an advanced ground-based air-defence system. Currently, the missiles are in service with the armed forces of over fifteen countries from around the world.

VThe Apple IIc, the fourth model in the Apple II series of personal computers, is Apple Computer\u2019s first endeavor to produce a portable computer. The result was a 7.5 lb (3.4 kg) notebook-sized version of the Apple II that could be transported from place to place. The c in the name stood for compact, referring to the fact it was essentially a complete Apple II computer setup (minus display and power supply) squeezed into a small notebook-sized housing. While sporting a built-in floppy drive and new rear peripheral expansion ports integrated onto the main logic board, it lacks the internal expansion slots and direct motherboard access of earlier Apple IIs, making it a closed system like the Macintosh. However, that was the intended direction for this model \u2014 a more appliance-like machine, ready to use out of the box, requiring no technical know-how or experience to hook up and therefore attractive to first-time users.

VThe Kornet (Russian: "\u041a\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0442"; English: Cornet) is a Russian anti-tank guided missile (ATGM). It is intended for use against main battle tanks, but is not intended to fully replace previous systems, due to its high cost. The missile carries the GRAU designation 9M133 and the NATO reporting name AT-14 Spriggan. It was first introduced into service with the Russian Army in 1998. Its export designation is the Kornet-E.

VThe FIRE (for "Fully Integrated Robotised Engine") is a series of automobile engines from Fiat Powertrain Technologies, built in FCA's Termoli, Betim and also in Dundee (only in 1.4 Multiair versions) plants. It was designed by Italian design firm Rodolfo Bonetto. It is constructed by robot assembly plants ("Robogate") to reduce costs.The FIRE series replaced the old Fiat 100 series OHV engines in the mid-1980s. Mechanically, they are simple straight-4 engines with five main bearings crankshaft and overhead cam heads.Since 1985, it has been constructed in different versions from 769 cc to 1368 cc with 8 valves; there is another version called the "Super-FIRE" which uses 16 valves and is available in 999 cc (Brazil) and 1242 cc (Brazil & Europe) displacements.The 1368 cc variation introduced in 2003 is available in both 8 and 16 valves; in 2005 Fiat introduced a version incorporating port deactivation (PDA) and EGR. This unit is frequently referred to as the "Starjet" engine. In 2005, a turbocharged version of 1368 cc was introduced as "T-Jet" engine, and a MultiAir (electro-hydraulic intake valve driving, with variable timing, lift and profile) version, available in either naturally aspirated and turbocharged versions, was added in 2009.The FIRE was originally a carburetor engine, and later progressed to single point injection (SPI), then to multipoint injection (MPI), using sequential multipoint injection (SMPI) now. It is now used in the 750 Formula in a slightly modified state.

VThe Taunus V4 was a 60° V4 piston engine with one balance shaft, introduced by Ford Motor Company in Germany in 1962. The German V4 was built in the Cologne plant and powered the Ford Taunus and German versions of the Consul, Capri and Transit.In common with other V4 and V6 engines, but unlike longer V engines with more cylinders, the connecting rods do not share a crankpin on the crankshaft.The V4 was later expanded into the Ford Cologne V6 engine that was used in the Ford Capri, Ford Taunus, Ford Cortina, Ford Consul, Ford Granada, Ford Sierra, Ford Scorpio, Ford Ranger, Ford Explorer and many other cars. The V4 engine was (and still is) also used in industrial applications: pumps, electrical generators, and in agricultural machinery and snowcats. In automobiles, the Taunus V4 was replaced by the Ford OHC/Pinto engine.Initially the V4 engine was designed by Ford for a new entry compact car intended for the US market to be called the Ford "Cardinal" which eventually evolved into the Taunus 12m P4. Ford abandoned the "Cardinal" project and sought other uses for the V4 engine which was initially tested in the Saab 96. Ford bought several SAAB 96's for testing and eventually sold the cars back to SAAB with the V4 engines in them. SAAB tested the V4 SAABs at their Trollhattan Sweden test track which stimulated SAAB to acquire the V4 engine for their model 95, 96, and model 97 (Sonett) cars starting in mid-year 1967 production. The V4 engine eliminated the need to mix oil with fuel for the two-cyle SAAB "Shrike" engine and provided better low end torque. SAAB dealers offered the first owner a "Lifetime Warranty" for the V4 for US$ 50.Applications:Ford TaunusFord ConsulFord TransitFord CapriSaab 95Saab 96Saab Sonett (II-V4 and III)Matra 530Ford Mustang I

VThe M3 Stuart, formally Light Tank M3, is an American light tank of World War II. It was supplied to British and Commonwealth forces under lend-lease prior to the entry of the U.S. into the war. Thereafter, it was used by U.S. and Allied forces until the end of the war.The name General Stuart or Stuart given by the British comes from the American Civil War Confederate General J.E.B. Stuart and was used for both the M3 and the derivative M5 Light Tank. In British service, it also had the unofficial nickname of Honey after a tank driver remarked "She's a honey". To the United States Army, the tanks were officially known only as "Light Tank M3" and "Light Tank M5".The M3 Stuarts were the first American-crewed tanks in World War II to engage the enemy in tank versus tank combat.

VThe IMSAI 8080 was an early microcomputer released in late 1975, based on the Intel 8080 and later 8085 and S-100 bus. It was a clone of its main competitor, the earlier MITS Altair 8800. The IMSAI is largely regarded as the first "clone" microcomputer. The IMSAI machine ran a highly modified version of the CP/M operating system called IMDOS. It was developed, manufactured and sold by IMS Associates, Inc. (later renamed IMSAI Manufacturing Corp). In total, between 17,000 and 20,000 units were produced from 1975 to 1978.

VTritonal is a mixture of 80% TNT and 20% aluminium powder, used in several types of ordnance such as air-dropped bombs. The aluminium improves the total heat output and hence impulse of the TNT - the length of time during which the blast wave is positive. Tritonal is approximately 18% more powerful than TNT alone.The 87 kg of tritonal in a Mark 82 bomb has the potential to produce approximately 863 MJ of energy if detonated.

VThe AMT Lightning 25/22 was a .22 LR-caliber semi-automatic rifle manufactured by Arcadia Machine & Tool (AMT).As is alluded to in the nomenclature, the Lightning 25/22 is functionally a clone of the Ruger 10/22 with the substitution of a larger 25-round magazine instead of the 10-round magazine used by Ruger. Also, the receiver is stainless steel rather than aluminum and features a Stainless Steel and Nylon folding stock and pistol grip rather than the wooden or composite stock mounted on the 10/22. The rifle also features an extended magazine release.The AMT Lightning line, which included direct clones of the Ruger 10/22 and Mark II pistol, eventually prompted a lawsuit against AMT that forced them to discontinue the line.The AMT Lightning was also exported to the UK and tuned by Theoben Engineering, the result was the AMT/Theoben Target Model. This rifle is known for its reliability; accuracy and rarity. Produced in very small numbers this rifle had a bull target barrel and a special evolution moderator to fit the larger barrel (.917). Many have suggested this rifle remains the most accurate factory finished semi-automatic ever produced and is a credit to the Anglo-American alliance of AMT and Theoben.

VThe Fucile Mitragliatore Breda modello 30 was the standard light machine gun of the Royal Italian Army during World War II.The Breda 30 was rather unusual for a light machine gun. It was fed from a fixed magazine attached to the right side of the weapon and was loaded using brass or steel 20-round stripper clips. If the magazine or its hinge/latch were damaged the weapon became unusable. It also fired from a closed bolt along with using blowback for its action. The blowback operation was violent, and often resulted in poor primary extraction. During primary extraction, the initial very small rearward movement of the hot expanded cartridge case away from the chamber's walls must be powerful but very slow, if an automatic weapon is to be reliable. Separated cases resulting in jamming of the weapon beyond field clearing, were usually the consequence of poor primary extraction. Breda 30 also inherently lacked good primary extraction in its design and thus utilized a small lubrication device that oiled each cartridge as it entered the chamber. With the dust and sand of the deserts of North Africa, came a combination of premature wear and jamming.As an automatic weapon's chamber and barrel heat up with prolonged automatic fire, the resulting excessive temperature can cause a chambered round to cook off or ignite without intent of the gunner. As a result of firing from a closed bolt, the Breda 30 could not fully take advantage of the cooling properties of air circulation like an open bolt weapon would, thus making cooked off rounds a realistic hazard. The disastrous results could lead to potential injuries to or even the death of the gunner. Some Bredas were eventually modified to accept the new 7.35 mm cartridge, which the Italian military was making an effort to adopt; however, this was short-lived as slowed production never fully allowed adoption of the new cartridge.In regular Army units, one Breda 30 was issued to each squad (standard issue was 24 to 27 per battalion), although this was later changed to two weapons per squad; an Italian infantry company would therefore have about six light machine guns in the early years of World War II (two per platoon), but this number eventually ballooned to twelve for the majority of the war (four per platoon).An infantry platoon was divided into two large sections, each of twenty men, which were further split into rifle and light machine gun squads. The section was commanded by a Sergeant, who also controlled the LMG squad. The latter was made up of two Breda 30s, each manned by a Corporal gunner, an assistant gunner and two ammunition bearers. The balance of the section was found in the rifle squad of eleven men. Due to the importance of its extra firepower, the Breda 30 was most often given to the squad's most reliable soldier (unlike other armies of the time, it was not rare to see an NCO brandishing himself the squad's automatic weapon). The manual indicates that the two squads were to operate as distinct elements, with the two LMGs supporting the Rifle squad onto its objective. At the time, most other armies embedded a light machine gun with each Section/Squad, themselves roughly half the size of the Italian Squad, which by comparison seems an unwieldy organisation. Individual weapons are given as pistols for each Corporal gunner, a carbine for the Major Sergeant and rifles for all others.The Wehrmacht adopted the Breda 30 in small numbers after the occupation of Northern and Central Italy, after the Italian armistice of 1943, using the nomenclature MG 099(i); it filled a similar role as the German MG 34, a light machine gun, predominantly utilized in the Italian Campaign battlefields.

VThe Hedgehog (also known as an Anti-Submarine Projector) was a forward-throwing anti-submarine weapon that was used during the Battle of the Atlantic in the Second World War. The device, which was developed by the Royal Navy, fired up to 24 spigot mortars ahead of a ship when attacking a U Boat. It was deployed on convoy escort warships such as destroyers and corvettes to supplement the depth charges.As the mortar projectiles employed contact fuzes rather than time or barometric (depth) fuzes, detonation always occurred directly against the hull of a submarine making it more deadly than depth charges which relied on damage caused by hydrostatic shockwaves. Statistics show that in the Second World War out of 5,174 British depth charge attacks there were 85.5 kills: a ratio of 60.5 to 1. In comparison, the Hedgehog made 268 attacks for 47 kills: a ratio of 5.7 to 1.

This system achieved a notable milestone in 2005 when missiles were fired against test targets in Shdema, Israel and scored direct hits. Since then, it has been showcased in multiple military exhibitions throughout the world.The SPYDER is a low-level, quick-reaction surface-to-air missile system capable of engaging aircraft, helicopters, unmanned air vehicles, drones, and precision-guided munitions. It provides air defence for fixed assets and for point and area defence for mobile forces in combat areas. The system is fitted atop a Tatra truck, a Mercedes-Benz Actros truck, a MAN TGS truck, Scania P-series truck, or a Dongfeng truck. It implements the Python-5 and Derby missiles of the same company. The SPYDER launcher is designed to fire Python-5 and Derby surface-to-air missiles which share full commonality with the air-to-air missiles. There are two variants of the SPYDER: the SPYDER-SR (short range) and the SPYDER-MR (medium range). Both systems are quick reaction, all weather, network-centric, multi-launchers, and self-propelled. A typical battery consists one central command and control unit, six missile firing units, and a resupply vehicle. The SPYDER-SR uses the EL/M-2106 ATAR radar while the SPYDER-MR incorporates the EL/M-2084 MMR radar. The latter is the same radar used by the Iron Dome system currently in service with the Israel Defense Forces.Current operators of the SPYDER missiles system include India and Singapore. Peru's order for the SPYDER was pending as of 2012. There are reports that claim that Georgia operated the SPYDER-SR during the 2008 Russo-Georgian War but these allegations and assumptions have never been verified.

VThe PT-91 Twardy ("hard","tough" or "resilient") is a Polish main battle tank. A development of the T-72M1, it first entered service in 1995. The PT-91 was designed at the OBRUM (OBRUM for O\u015brodek Badawczo-Rozwojowy Urz\u0105dze\u0144 Mechanicznych \u2013 Polish for Research and Development Centre for Mechanical Appliances) and is produced by the Bumar \u0141ab\u0119dy company, part of Polish military consortium Bumar Group. Changes from the T-72 include a new dual-axis stabilized fire-control system, reactive armour, a more powerful engine, transmission and new automatic loader. Unlike many other T-72 upgrades, the Polish Army PT-91s are upgraded using elements created almost exclusively by domestic companies, including a new engine, the fire control system and all communication system elements. Many of those elements were used to upgrade existing fleets of T-72 tanks in countries like in Czech Republic (T-72M4 CZ), Georgia (T-72SIM-1) or India (T-72 Ajeya Mk. 2).

VThe Samsung Galaxy 3, also known as the Samsung Galaxy Apollo, Galaxy Mini in Italy, or Samsung Galaxy 580 in Hong Kong, is a smartphone manufactured by Samsung that runs the open source Android operating system. Announced and released by Samsung in July 2010, the Galaxy 3 succeeds the Galaxy Spica.Being a budget, mid-range smartphone that was designed for the mass market, the Galaxy 3 had several compromises over the Galaxy S in terms of hardware.The Galaxy Apollo is a variant of the Galaxy 3 that is also known as the GT-I5800. This was also released as carrier-exclusive sub-variants by Orange (i5801) in the UK, Optimus (i5801) in Portugal and by Telus Mobility (i5800L / Samsung Apollo) in Canada. Compared to the normal Apollo/I5800, the carrier-exclusive models include a different front design, which has touch sensitive buttons instead of physical keys, a more rounded home button, and a slightly different back.The Samsung Galaxy 3 won bronze of the CNET Asia Reader's Choice Award for Best Entry-Level Smartphone in 2010.

VThe Volkswagen D24 engine is a 2.4-litre inline-six-cylinder (R6/I6), naturally aspirated diesel engine, formerly manufactured by Volkswagen Group from 1978 to 1995.Subsequent forced induction variants of this engine were also available as the Volkswagen D24T engine with a turbocharger, and a turbo intercooled version, the Volkswagen D24TIC engine. These turbocharged variants resulted in higher power and torque outputs.

VThe Sony Ericsson Cedar (j108i), also known as Sony Ericsson Cedar GreenHeart, is a mobile phone from SE's J series of phones produced by Sony Ericsson released in September 2010. It is no longer in production/sale from the producer. The phone is one of Sony Ericsson's environmentally friendly "Greenheart" range, featuring devices made of recycled materials, longer battery life and low-energy chargers, as well as minimal use of paper through reduced packaging and the replacement of the traditional printed user manual with one stored on the phone.

VThe Sord M5 is a home computer launched by Sord Computer Corporation in 1982. Primarily the Sord M5 competed in the Japanese home computer market. It was also sold as the CGL M5 in the United Kingdom by Computer Games Limited, and was reasonably popular in Czechoslovakia, where the M5 stood as one of the first affordable computers available to the general public. Takara also sold models in Japan as the Game M5, and models were also exported to South Korea.Original models of the Sord M5 are relatively small by home computing standards, with a built in keyboard with rubber keys, similar to the ZX Spectrum. The specifications of the computer are very similar to the MSX, a computer which likely forced the Sord M5 (along with many similar Japanese computers) out of the market by the mid-1980s.The CGL M5 was released in the UK with an introductory price of £195, higher than many of the system's competitors including the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Acorn Atom and Commodore VIC-20. Whereas the M5 contained a cartridge slot in an age where most computers were using compact cassettes or floppy disks, the lack of built-in RAM led to few games being produced for the system.In South Korea, two electronics companies released different personal computers based on Sord M5. The FC-150 was produced and released by LG and the TommyCom was manufactured and launched by Koryo Systems. Both computers supported the Korean alphabet, Hangul. The system specifications of these computers were identical to the original M5 but they had differently shaped cartridge slots. Cartridges from the Sord M5 or other manufacturers could not be used on these computers directly. LG released some original software including several educational programs and games.Despite its short production run, the M5 was supported by various big Japanese game developers such as Namco and Konami.Other models include the M5 Pro and M5 Jr.

VThe Lynx was an 8-bit British home computer that was first released in early 1983 as a 48 kB model. Several models were available with 48 kB, 96 kB or 128 kB RAM. It was possible to reach 192 kB with RAM expansions on board. John Shireff designed the hardware and Davis Jansons the firmware.The machine was based around a Z80A CPU clocked at 4 MHz, (6 MHz for the 128/192 kB models) and featured a Motorola 6845 as video controller. It was possible to run CP/M with the optional 5.25" floppy disk-drive on the 96 kB and 128 kB models.The machine was quite advanced for its time. A 48k machine cost £225, a 96k machine £299 and a 128k machine £345. When compared to its competitors, such as the Sinclair ZX Spectrum and the Oric 1, it was also fairly highly priced. Camputers rebranded and relaunched each machine on several occasions, with the 48k machine renamed the Leisure, and the 128k machine renamed as the Laureate.The machine had very little software available, and survived only until Camputers ceased trading in June 1984. It is believed that approximately 30,000 Camputers Lynx units were sold worldwide.Anston Technology took over in November 1984 and a re-launch was planned but never happened. In June 1986, Anston sold everything - hardware, design rights and thousands of cassettes - to the National Lynx User Group. The group planned to produce a Super-Lynx but was too busy supplying spares and technical information to owners of existing models, and the project never came into being.Unique features of this computer (compared to other home computers at the time) includes:A quite large BASIC, including graphics commands, in line CODE sentence for inclusion of machine code in hex. All numbers were floating point BCD numbers (even line numbers).A monitor program allowed hex dumps, copy, compare etc.The computer always ran in "high" resolution graphics mode (256x252 pixels in eight colours) using 6 times 10 pixels characters. Only a few bytes of graphic memory could be manipulated during the horizontal sync period, and thus graphics were extremely slow compared to most other computers.Up to 192 kB of RAM and 20 kB of ROM (16 kB on the smallest model) on a 16 bit address bus was implemented using special hardware. As a consequence, certain RAM areas shadowed by ROM could only be used for data storage and the video memory had a green and alternative green bank that could be switched by a hardware register.For sound it had a simple (6 bit) DAC. A comparator was included to serve as an ADC (primarily used for reading from tape drives).Compared to, for example, the Commodore 64, the BASIC was more extensive and faster and resolution of graphics was better; but computer games on the other hand suffered from the special implementation and lack of hardware for sound and sprites. Thus, it was better for exploring programming or working with maths.

VThe Lynx is a family of tracked armoured vehicles developed by Rheinmetall Landsysteme (part of Rheinmetall\u2019s Vehicle Systems division). The Lynx, in infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) configuration, was unveiled publicly at the Eurosatory defence exhibition on June 14, 2016.According to Rheinmetall, the Lynx family of tracked armoured vehicles is at the forefront of a new trend in IFV design toward armoured vehicles with lower unit and through-life costs and reduced complexity. One of the key principles of the Lynx concept is the integration of proven sub-systems with high Technology Readiness Level (TRL) to reduce development time, cost and technical risk.

VThe QF 4.5 inch gun has been the standard medium-calibre naval gun used by the Royal Navy as a medium range weapon capable of use against surface, aircraft and shore bombardment targets since 1938. This article covers the early 45-calibre family of guns up to the 1970s. For the later unrelated 55-calibre Royal Navy gun, see 4.5 inch Mark 8 naval gun.Like all British nominally 4.5 inch naval guns, the QF Mk I has an actual calibre of 4.45 inches (113 mm).

VAGM-45 Shrike is an American anti-radiation missile designed to home in on hostile anti-aircraft radar. The Shrike was developed by the Naval Weapons Center at China Lake in 1963 by mating a seeker head to the rocket body of an AIM-7 Sparrow. It was phased out by U.S. in 1992 and at an unknown time by the Israeli Air Force (the only other major user), and has been superseded by the AGM-88 HARM missile. The Israel Defense Forces developed a version of the Shrike that could be ground-launched and mounted it on an M4 Sherman chassis as the Kilshon (Hebrew for Trident).

VThe Alfa Romeo Boxer engine was a water-cooled flat-4 piston engine developed by Alfa Romeo for front-wheel drive, longitudinal applications. It debuted on the Alfasud, which was introduced in 1971 at the Turin Motor Show. In the following decades the Boxer went through several upgrades and powered all Alfa Romeo front-wheel drive cars up to 1996. In 1997 it was phased out and replaced by the transverse-mounted Twin Spark engines.

VThe Ford Duratec V6, also known as the Mondeo V6 is an aluminum DOHC V6 with a 60° bank angle introduced in 1993 with the Ford Mondeo. The primary engineering input came from Porsche, who were developing a similar V6 before selling the engineering to Ford, and Cosworth, who helped with cylinder head manufacturing. The Jaguar AJ-V6 engine is similar but adds variable valve timing. Mazda's AJ version also has this feature.Ford Motor Company's modern 2.5 L and 3.0 L V6 automobile engines are evolutions of the same design, first used in the 1995 Ford Contour. This line is sold under the brand name "Duratec", as are many other engines.

VThe Captive Air Amphibious Transporter (CAAT) is a 1:5 scale tracked amphibious vehicle prototype being developed by DARPA. It drives on the water with air-filled pontoons attached to the tracks, and is intended to demonstrate how to transport standard 20- or 40-foot containers from ordinary container ships to shore without using a harbor. DARPA is investigating its usefulness in disasters so that commercial shipping can relieve military ships to focus on military tasks. The CAAT is one of four elements in the Tactically Expandable Maritime Platform (TEMP) program; the others being a containerized living quarter, a stabilized crane, and an unmanned powered parachute delivering containers by air.

VThe TRS-80 Model 100 is a portable computer introduced in 1983. It is one of the first notebook-style computers, featuring a keyboard and liquid crystal display, in a battery-powered package roughly the size and shape of a notepad or large book.It was made by Kyocera, and originally sold in Japan as the Kyotronic 85. Although a slow seller for Kyocera, the rights to the machine were purchased by Tandy Corporation. The computer was sold through Radio Shack stores in the United States and Canada and affiliated dealers in other countries. It became one of the company's most popular models, with over 6,000,000 units sold worldwide. The Olivetti M-10 and the NEC PC-8201 and PC-8300 were also built on the same Kyocera platform, with some design and hardware differences. It was originally marketed as a Micro Executive Work Station (MEWS), although the term did not catch on and was eventually dropped.

VHelepolis (Greek: \u1f11\u03bb\u03ad\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2, English: "Taker of Cities") is the Greek name for a movable siege tower. The most famous one was the siege engine invented by Polyidus of Thessaly and improved by Demetrius I of Macedon and Epimachus of Athens for the unsuccessful Siege of Rhodes (305 BC), based on an earlier design used against Salamis (306 BC). It was neither the first nor the largest helepolis. According to W. Murray, the earliest helepolis was constructed by Polyadis for Philip II of Macedon in 340 BC for the siege of Perinthus. The largest recorded helepolis was used by the same Demetrius in the siege of Salamis in Cyprus in 306 BC. The name was derived from "\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2", meaning taking or capturing cities. Descriptions of it were written by Diodorus Siculus, Vitruvius, Plutarch, and in the Athenaeus Mechanicus.The rest of the description applies to the Helepolis used in Rhodes in 305-306 BC, because little is known about other ones.

VThe sagaris is an ancient Iranian (or Persian) shafted weapon used by the horse-riding ancient North-Iranian Saka and Scythian peoples of the great Eurasian steppe. It was used also by Western and Central Asian peoples: the Medes, Persians, Parthayans, Indo-Saka, Kushans, Mossynoeci, and others living within the milieu of Iranian peoples. According to Aristarchus of Samothrace, the legendary Amazons used the sagaris, as well. In The Histories, Herodotus attributes the sagaris to the Sacae Scythians in the army-list of Xerxes the Great.The sagaris was a kind of battle-axe. Examples have been collected from Eurasian steppe archeological excavations, and are depicted on the Achaemenid cylinders and ancient Greek pottery and other surviving iconographic material. It is a long-shafted weapon with a metal head, with an either sharp (ax-like) or blunt (hammer-like) edge on one side and a sharp (straight or curving) 'ice-pick'-like point on the other. It may have been the sagaris that led medieval and Renaissance authors (such as Johannes Aventinus) to attribute the invention of the battle-axe weapon to the Amazons - as some Scythian women seen hunting and along warrior riders gave legend to the Amazons selves -, and to the modern association of the Amazons with the Labrys.A shorter form, depicted on coins as held by Spalirises, was labelled klevets by Russian archaeologist and ancient military historian V.P. Nikonorov.

VThe BMW N20 is a turbocharged straight-4 DOHC gasoline piston engine which replaced the N52 and BMW N53 straight-6 engines, and has been in production since 2011-present.The N20 features a twin-scroll turbocharger, variable valve timing (called VANOS by BMW), variable valve lift (called valvetronic by BMW) and direct injection. The N20 is sold alongside the smaller displacement BMW N13 turbocharged straight-4 engine.While the N20 is a straight-4, it is considered a replacement for the naturally-aspirated straight-6 N52 and N53 because it powers equivalent models, producing similar horsepower to its straight-6 predecessors with greater lower-end torque and better efficiency.The N20 was placed in Wards Top 10 Engines in 2012.

VThe BMW N55 is a turbocharged direct injection straight-6 DOHC engine which began production in 2009 and presently (2015) remains in production. It was launched in the F07 535i Gran Turismo. The N55 began to be phased out following the introduction of the B58 engine in 2015.Compared with its N54 predecessor, the N55 features a single twin-scroll turbo (the N54 uses twin turbos) and variable valve lift (called Valvetronic by BMW).The F80 M3 and F82 M4 are powered by the S55 engine, which is the high performance version of the N55.

VThe Type 38 rifle Arisaka (\u4e09\u516b\u5f0f\u6b69\u5175\u9283, san-hachi-shiki hoheij\u016b) was a bolt-action rifle that supplemented the Type 99 Japanese standard infantry rifle during the Second World War. The design was adopted by the Imperial Japanese Army in 1905 (the 38th year of the Meiji period, hence "Type 38") and served from then until the end of 1945.

VThe Mercedes-Benz M273 engine is a V8 automobile piston engine family used in the 2000s (decade). It was based on the similar M272 V6 introduced in 2004.An evolution of the M113 V8, all M273s have aluminum engine blocks, SFI fuel injection, forged steel connecting rods, a one-piece cast camshaft, and a magnesium intake manifold. The cylinders are lined with silicon/aluminum, and a dual-length Variable Length Intake Manifold is fitted.In addition to this, new features shared with the M272 include DOHC aluminum cylinder heads, 4 valves per cylinder and independent continuously variable valve timing on both the intake and exhaust sides. A new electronically controlled cooling system has eliminated the need for a mechanical thermostat for improved engine warm-up and optimum control of engine temperature.

VThe Mercedes-Benz M278 is a family of direct injected, Twin-Turbocharged, V8 gasoline automotive piston engines.The M278 is derived from the company's previous M273 V8 engine, sharing its bore pitch, aluminium engine block, and Silitec aluminium/silicon low-friction cylinder liners. In contrast to the port-injected M273, the M278 features gasoline direct injection, with piezo-electrically actuated fuel injectors for more precise fuel delivery, and multi-spark ignition, which enables the spark plugs to be fired multiple times over the combustion sequence for more efficient combustion. Other changes relative to the M273 include an increased adjustment range for the variable valve timing system, a new timing chain arrangement, and new engine accessories (such as the oil pump, water pump, fuel pump, and alternator) which reduce parasitic loads. Many of these new features are shared with the M276 V6 engine family, which was announced at the same time.While the M273 was naturally aspirated, the M278 features twin turbochargers, one per cylinder bank, producing 0.9 bar boost pressure in most configurations.Mercedes-Benz estimate that these changes, in conjunction with vehicle modifications such as a stop-start system, allow the 4.6 liter M278 to have 22% lower fuel consumption and CO2 emissions than the 5.5 liter M273 while producing more power (429 hp versus 382 hp) and torque (516 ft·lbf versus 391 ft·lbf). The M278 is also more refined than its predecessor.The entire M278 lineup avoids the United States Gas Guzzler Tax, a first for V8 production engines from Mercedes-Benz.

VThe aruval (Tamil: \u0b85\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bcd) is a type of billhook from India, particularly common in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. It is used both as a tool and a weapon. Tamils revere the weapon as a symbol of Karupannar. In popular culture it is sometimes associated with gangsters. In movies, it is used as a weapon of choice.

VThe Commodore 8050 and Commodore 8250 are dual-unit 5¼" floppy disk drives for Commodore International computers. They use a wide rectangular steel case form similar to that of the Commodore 4040, and use the IEEE-488 interface common to Commodore PET/CBM computers.The 8050 is a single-sided drive, whereas the 8250 can use both sides of a disk simultaneously. Both use a quad density format storing approximately 0.5 megabyte per side. The density of media is similar to later PC high density floppy disks, but with the original 300-oersted coercivity used by double density drives. The 8050 and 8250 did not write with enough power to use 600-oersted PC high density disks reliably. As quad-density disks were rare even at the time that these were current models, users quickly found that typical double density floppy disks had enough magnetic media density to work in these drives.These drives are not dual-mode, so they cannot read or write disks formatted by the more common lower-capacity Commodore 1541 or Commodore 4040 models.Some variants of these drives exist. The Commodore 8250LP is the 8250 in a lower profile, tan-colored case. The Commodore SFD-1001 is a single-drive version of the 8250 in a Commodore 1541-style case (similarly to the Commodore 2031LP), often used by bulletin board systems for their physical similarity to 1541s and high capacity and speed.

It is the first device of the third Android smartphone series produced by Samsung. It was announced to the press in March 2010 and released for sale in June 2010.The Galaxy S is produced in over two dozen variations. The international 'GT-I9000' reference version features a 1 GHz ARM "Hummingbird" processor, a PowerVR graphics processor, 8 or 16 GB of internal flash memory, a 4 in (10 cm) 480×800 pixel Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen display, Wi-Fi connectivity, a 5-megapixel primary camera and a 0.3-megapixel secondary front-facing camera. Derivative models may include localized cellular radios or changes to button layouts, keyboards, screens, cameras or the Android OS.At the time of its release, the Galaxy S included the fastest graphical processing of any smartphone, was the thinnest smartphone at 9.9 mm and was the first Android phone to be certified for DivX HD.As of 2013, over 25 million Galaxy S units have been sold. The Galaxy S name continued on with the semi-related Snapdragon-based Galaxy S Plus and NovaThor-based Galaxy S Advance smartphones. The next major release of the series was the Samsung Galaxy S II.In 2012, Samsung introduced the dual SIM version of the Galaxy S, Samsung Galaxy S Duos.

VThe Ronson system was a flamethrower for vehicle mounting developed in World War II and used by the Canadian Army and the United States Marine Corps.The Ronson was developed by the British Petroleum Warfare Department in 1940. Having insufficient range it was passed over for British use but taken up by the Canadians for further work. The Ronson was sufficiently developed in time to be used for production of the "Wasp MkIIC" flamethrower variant of the Universal Carrier.From there it came to the attention of the United States and was adopted as the Satan. The United States used an M4 Sherman tank adapted with a Navy Mark 1 flamethrower, which was a development of the Ronson by the United States Navy. These tanks were used in the Battle of Iwo Jima and during Operation Overlord. The Navy Mark I was also used on the Landing Vehicle Tracked LVT(4).

VThe Ames strain is one of 89 known strains of the anthrax bacterium (Bacillus anthracis). It was isolated from a diseased 14-month-old Beefmaster heifer that died in Sarita, Texas in 1981. The strain was isolated at the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory and a sample was sent to the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). Researchers at USAMRIID mistakenly believed the strain came from Ames, Iowa because the return address on the package was the USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames and mislabeled the specimen.The Ames strain came to wide public attention in association with the 2001 anthrax attacks. Seven letters mailed to media outlets and US Senators on September 18, 2001 and October 9, 2001 contained anthrax bacteria of this particular strain. This strain is a monomorphic disease, mutating slowly if at all.Because of its virulence, the Ames strain is used by the United States as something of a gold standard for development of vaccines and testing their effectiveness, starting in the 1980s, after work on weaponizing the Vollum 1B strain ended and all weaponized stocks were destroyed after the end of the U.S. biological warfare program in 1969.

Two variants of the Ghauri were produced under the secretive missile research programme started in 1987 and the development of a third variant was cancelled. The Ghauri-II uses increased motor assembly length and improved propellants for an increased range of 2,300 km (1,400 mi).The missile is named after Shahabuddin Muhammad Ghauri, while the "Hatf" designation originates from the name of the sword or lance of Muhammad.

VThe CZ Model 25 (properly, Sa 25 or Sa vz. 48b/samopal vz. 48b \u2013 samopal vzor 48 výsadkový, "submachine gun model year 1948 para") was perhaps the best known of a series of Czechoslovak designed submachine guns introduced in 1948. There were four generally very similar submachine guns in this series: the Sa 23, Sa 24, Sa 25, and Sa 26. The primary designer was Jaroslav Hole\u010dek (1923\u20131977), chief engineer of the \u010ceská zbrojovka Strakonice arms factory.The Sa 23 series utilize a straightforward blowback action, with no locked breech, and fire from the open bolt position. They also use a progressive trigger for selecting between semi-automatic fire and fully automatic fire. Lightly pulling on the trigger will fire a single shot. Pulling the trigger farther to the rear in a continuous motion will fire fully automatically, until the trigger is released or the magazine is empty.The Sa 23 series were the first production-model submachine guns with a telescoping bolt, in which the forward part of the moving bolt extends forwards past the back end of the barrel, wrapping around that barrel. This feature reduces the required length of the submachine gun significantly and allows for better balance and handling. Handling was further improved by using a single vertical handgrip housing the magazine and trigger mechanism, roughly centered along the gun's length. The gun's receiver was machined from a single circular steel tube.The design of the Sa 23 series submachine guns is most notable in the West for having inspired the open-bolt, blowback-operated design of the slightly later Uzi submachine gun.

VA floating breech is a breechblock of a firearm that is not held rigidly to the barrel at the moment of firing, but instead is free to move in the opposite direction to the projectile. This can help to reduce the recoil induced in the body of the firearm so long as the subsequent motion of the breechblock is retarded in some manner - either by a spring, or by back-pressure against a piston attached to the breechblock provided by tapping the expelled propellant gases. The motion of the breech and/or the expansion of the expelled gases can also be used to power a case-ejection mechanism and/or reloading mechanism.If the ammunition is caseless, the time required to expel the previous case is removed from the cycle time of an automatic firearm and a higher rate of fire can be obtained than with normal ammunition.The Heckler & Koch G11 Assault rifle uses caseless ammunition, but has a rotating breech, not a floating breech. However, the barrel, breech and magazine as a whole 'float' within the housing of the weapon. Note that the breechblock in this firearm rotates about an axis perpendicular to the main axis of the barrel, whereas most other rotating breechblocks rotate about the same axis as the long axis of the barrel.

VThe T95 was an American prototype medium tank developed from 1955 to 1959. These tanks used many advanced or unusual features, such as siliceous-cored armor, a new transmission, and the OPTAC fire-control system. The OPTAC incorporated an electro-optical rangefinder and was mounted on the right side of the turret, and was used in conjunction with the APFSDS-firing 90 mm T208 smoothbore gun, which had a rigid mount without a recoil system. In addition, although the tanks were designed with a torsion beam suspension, a hydropneumatic suspension was fitted, and one of the tanks was fitted with a Solar Saturn gas turbine for demonstration purposes.The siliceous cored armor consisted of fused silica, which has a mass efficiency of approximately three versus copper-lined shaped charges, embedded in cast steel armor for an overall mass efficiency of 1.4. The early APFSDS penetrators fired by the T208 had a low length-to-diameter ratio, this being limited by their brittle tungsten carbide construction, with a diameter of 37 mm, although they had a high muzzle velocity of 1,525 meters per second (5,000 feet per second). The rangefinder, the T53 Optical Tracking, Acquisition and Ranging (OPTAR) system, emitted pulsed beams of intense but incoherent infrared light. These incoherent beams scattered easily, reducing effectiveness in mist and rain and causing multiple returns, requiring the gunner to identify the correct return after estimating the range by sight. This, combined with the large and vulnerable design of the transmitter and receiver assembly, led to the abandonment of the OPTAR system in 1957.

VThe RP-3 (from Rocket Projectile 3 inch) was a British rocket projectile used during and after the Second World War. Though primarily an air-to-ground weapon, it saw limited use in other roles. Its 60 lb (27 kg ) warhead gave rise to the alternative name of the "60 lb rocket"; the 25 lb (11.3 kg) solid-shot armour-piercing variant was referred to as the "25 lb rocket". They were generally used by British fighter-bomber aircraft against targets such as tanks, trains, motor transport and buildings, and by Coastal Command and Royal Navy aircraft against U-boats and shipping. The "3 inch" designation referred to the diameter of the rocket motor tube.

VThe Sony Glasstron was a portable head-mounted display. The products included two LCD screens and two earphones for video and audio respectively.The Glasstron was released to the U.S. market in 1997.Various models were released. Supported video inputs included PC (15 pin, VGA interface), Composite and S-Video. A brief list of the models follows:PLM-A35: The most basic model with opaque lenses and no SVGA input.PLM-A55: This model had a mechanical shutter to allow the display to become see through, without SVGA.PLM-100: This model had a mechanical shutter to allow the display to become see through, with SVGA, somewhat unstable.PLM-S700: The S700 allowed for see through mode using LCD shutters and had support for SVGA output.PLM-S700E was the final model and used some of the world's most advanced components at the time. Its LCD had over 1.5 million pixels on a component the size of a ten-cent coin at SVGA (800×600) display resolution.These products are no longer manufactured nor supported by Sony. The PlayStation VR can be considered in a way the successor to Glasstron.

VThe Sony Glasstron was a family of portable head-mounted displays, first released in 1996 with the model PLM-50. The products included two LCD screens and two earphones for video and audio respectively. These products are no longer manufactured nor supported by Sony.The Glasstron was not the first head-mounted display by Sony, with the Visortron being a previous exhibited unit. The Sony HMZ-T1, HMZ-T2, HMZ-T3 and PlayStation VR can be considered successors to Glasstron.One application of this technology was in the game MechWarrior 2, which permitted users to adopt a visual perspective from inside the cockpit of the craft, using their own eyes as visual and seeing the battlefield through their craft's own cockpit.

VThe Mercedes-Benz OM642 engine is a 3.0-liter, 72° 24-valve, aluminum block diesel V6 engine manufactured by the Mercedes-Benz division of Daimler AG as a replacement for the Mercedes-Benz inline-5 and -6 engines.The engine features common rail fuel injection and a variable nozzle turbocharger. The injection system operates at 1,600 bar (23,000 psi), while the compression ratio is 18:1. The engine features a counter-rotating balance shaft mounted between the cylinder banks to cancel the vibrations inherent to the 72 degree V6 design, and the crankpins are offset by 48 degrees to achieve even 120 degree firing intervals. In some heavy vehicle applications, Mercedes' BlueTec AdBlue urea injection is utilised for NOx reduction. In lighter vehicle applications, a NOx storage catalyst captures nitrous oxides, which are periodically purged (decomposed) by running the engine slightly rich. A particulate filter lowers soot, making this engine ULEV certified. Engine mass is 208 kg (459 lb). Power output is 165 kW (224 PS; 221 hp) and 510 N·m (380 lb·ft) of torque. For the 2007 model year, torque is raised to 540 Nm.

VThe Mark 24 mine (also known as FIDO or Fido) was a US air-dropped passive acoustic homing anti-submarine torpedo used during the Second World War against German and Japanese submarines. It entered service in March 1943 and continued in service with the US Navy until 1948. Approximately 4,000 torpedoes were produced, sinking 37 and damaging a further 18 submarines out of a total of 204 fired. The torpedo was also supplied to the British and Canadian forces. The deceptive name of "Mark 24 Mine" was deliberately chosen for security purposes, to conceal the true nature of the weapon.

VThe Parker Hale M85 is a British bolt-action .308 sniper rifle, with an effective range around 900 metres. It fires from a 10-round detachable magazine, and weighs 12 pounds, telescopic sight included. The rifle was created after the Falklands War by Parker Hale Ltd in response to shortcomings in the contemporary Lee\u2013Enfield L42A1. Although the Parker Hale M85 manufacturing licence was sold to Gibbs Rifle Co., it has not yet resumed production.

VThe Nokia 6100 is a popular mid-range Nokia mobile phone that was available from 2002 to 2005. It has since been discontinued in favour of more advanced models.The Nokia 6100 was Nokia's lightest phone ever with a full 12-key keypad. Combined with its battery, it weighs only 76 grams (2.68 ounces) and measures 102 x 44 x 13.5 mm. Its smaller size compared to other contemporary phones might make it difficult for the elderly, or people with large fingers, to use its keypad. The phone does support X-Press On covers, and is packaged along with any of 4 colours.The Nokia 6100 has a display with a resolution of 128 x 128 pixels, featuring 12-bit color (allowing for 4096 possible colors). Its features include Internet connectivity via GPRS, an infrared port, inbuilt calendar and polyphonic ring tones. It does not have a camera. It could be considered the true successor of the Nokia 8210 and Nokia 8250 in terms of design functionality and its small flat size.The LCD screen comes in two main versions which are very similar. One version of the LCD is controlled by an EPSON S1D15G00 driver chip, whilst the other version uses a Philips PCF8833 instead. There are also clones of these drivers. Early releases had a slightly blurry, yellower and duller screen compared to the Nokia 7210 and 6610 of the same period, but later screens improved this shortcoming.Both driver chips allow the display to be used with 8-bit (256 colors) or 12-bit (4096 colors) RGB. Only the Philips version provides, on a low-level, the ability to use 16-bit RGB. This is achieved through dithering. 16-bit RGB gives 65536 different colors, sixteen times that available in the Nokia 12-bit RGB colour mode.

VThe Autoblinda 40, 41 and 43 (abbreviated AB 40, 41 and 43) were Italian armoured cars produced by Fiat-Ansaldo and which saw service mainly during World War II. Most autoblinde were armed with a 20 mm Breda 35 autocannon and a coaxial 8 mm machine gun in a turret similar to the one fitted to the Fiat L6/40, and another hull mounted rear-facing 8 mm machine gun.

VThe Wii U GamePad is the standard controller for Nintendo's Wii U video game console. Incorporating traits from tablet computers, the GamePad has traditional input methods (such as buttons, dual analog sticks, and a D-pad), touchscreen controls, and motion controls. The touchscreen can be used to supplement a game by providing alternate, second screen functionality or an asymmetric view of a scenario in a game. The screen can also be used to play a game strictly on the GamePad screen, without the use of a television display. Conversely, non-gaming functions can be assigned to it as well, such as using it as a television remote.The Wii U GamePad can be used in conjunction with other controllers compatible with the console, such as the Wii Remote Plus, Wii Balance Board, and the more conventional Wii U Pro Controller.

VA Nuclear Depth Bomb (NDB) is the nuclear equivalent of the conventional depth charge and can be used in Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) for attacking submerged submarines. The British Royal Navy, Soviet Navy and United States Navy had nuclear depth bombs in their arsenals at one point.Due to the use of a nuclear warhead of much greater explosive power than that of the conventional depth charge, the Nuclear Depth Bomb considerably increases the likelihood (to the point of near certainty) of the destruction of the attacked submarine.Because of this much greater power some NDBs feature a variable yield, whereby the explosive energy of the device may be varied between a low setting for use in shallow or coastal waters, and a high yield for deep water open-sea use. This is intended to minimize damage to peripheral areas and shipping.All nuclear anti-submarine weapons were withdrawn from service by the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and China in or around 1990. They were replaced by conventional weapons such as the Mark 54 Torpedo that provided ever-increasing accuracy and range as ASW technology improved.

VThe 4.25 mm Liliput pistol is one of the smallest semiautomatic handguns ever made (the Kolibri is generally considered the smallest). Hence its name, derived from the fictional island of Lilliput, inhabited by tiny people.The Liliput was manufactured by Waffenfabrik August Menz in Suhl, Germany from approximately 1920 to 1927. Menz also manufactured a similar .25 ACP pistol introduced in 1925 as the Model 1, and a .32 ACP pistol sold as the Beholla Pistol. Overall length of the Liliput was 4.25 inches and barrel length was 13\u20444 inches.Because the pistol uses a 4.25 mm (.167 in) cartridge (which became known as the 4.25mm Liliput and which is considered obsolete), the Liliput is one of the few pistols that can be owned in the United Kingdom without a license.The Liliput features in a number of novels by Alistair MacLean.

VThe BMW M78 is a straight-six OHV piston engine. It is the first straight-six automobile engine produced by BMW. The engine initially had the same bore and stroke as the four cylinder engine from the BMW 3/20; the bore spacing was increased to allow for further increases in bore and to provide for more crankshaft bearings. The engine was designed by Fritz Fiedler.

VThe Mitsubishi 8A8 engine is a range of V8 powerplants produced by Mitsubishi Motors since 1999. The only variant to date is the 8A80, a 4.5 L with double overhead camshafts and gasoline direct injection (GDI) technology. Financial pressures forced the company to discontinue sales of the Proudia and Dignity, the only vehicles in its range to which it was fitted, after only fifteen months.However, the two vehicles were developed in partnership with the Hyundai Motor Company of South Korea, with whom Mitsubishi has had a longstanding relationship. While Mitsubishi makes the cylinder heads and other GDI-related equipment, Hyundai casts the aluminium block, and other major internal components. Hyundai's version of the Proudia/Dignity, the Equus, proved more successful, and this has been the sole application of the powerplant since 2001. Hyundai replaced the engine with its newly developed Tau V8 in 2008 when the second generation rear wheel drive Equus replaced the first model.

VThe Nokia 6030 is a GSM dual band handset operating on frequencies 900 and 1800 MHz (850 and 1900 MHz in the North American model), with automatic switching between frequencies. It is small in size with dimensions of 104 x 44 x 18 mm and weighs 90 grams. It also has 3MB Shared Memory.Its key features are:High-resolution color display with up to 65,536 colors (128 x 128 pixels)Multimedia messaging (MMS)GPRS and WAP 2.0 servicesNokia Series 40 Theme compatibilityFM radio (with supported Nokia headset)MIDI audio playback (up to 16 channels)Address book, calendar, and remindersJava ME compatibilityXpress-on coversThe 6030 supports GPRS up to 40 kbit/s speed and Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) 2.0 services. An XHTML browser is integrated, allowing for WAP web capability. The phone book can hold up to 300 entries and its calendar can hold up to 500 entries. It has been proven to be a very durable phone, with users reporting dropping it several times, throwing it across a room, dropping it into water, etc. with the phone still running afterward.On the bottom panel of the Nokia 6030 is a 4-pin connector similar to a USB port, a bit smaller than normal 4-pin mini-USB connectors, but it is an FBus port, named the EZ Flash port, and the data cable for this port is not supplied for end-users. Only authorized Nokia support have the ability to make use of the port. There is no official data cable connection for 6030 end-user. Those so-called "CA-45" cables for sale are counterfeits or an attempt to copy a Nokia special EZ flash cable, CA-45DS. The official Nokia CA-45DS has a connector that fits into the headphone jack and the FBus port on one end, and the other end is a connection much like an Ethernet cable that hooks into the flash box.

VThe Honda G-series engine is a family of slanted inline-five cylinder gasoline engines; the engines are SOHC with 4 valves per cylinder. They were originally used in the 1989 Honda Vigor, Honda Rafaga, Honda Ascot and Honda Inspire. They carried over to the Vigor's successor the Acura 2.5TL, which ran from 1995-1998 in North America, and the Honda Saber in Japan.Some people colloquially refer to an F-Series block (found in Accords) with an H-Series head (found in Preludes) as a "G-series" engine. This combination of an Accord bottom end with a Prelude head has nothing in common with the actual G-series engine. The engine is longitudinally mounted and resembles an F-Series single cam engine (found in early Accords) with an extra cylinder on it and a shorter stroke.

Although designated a light tank by the Italian Army, its turretless configuration, weight and firepower make it closer to contemporary tankettes. It was the most numerous Italian armoured fighting vehicle and saw service almost everywhere the Italians fought in World War II but proved inadequate for modern warfare having too thin armour and weak armament of only machine guns.

VHanwei is a company manufacturing swords, operated by Chen Chao-Po, better known by his pseudonym Paul Chen.Chen is a Chinese sword collector who in ca. 1991 opened a factory in Dalian manufacturing inexpensive replicas of Edo period Japanese swords. The manufacturing process imitates methods of traditional Japanese swordsmiths, for a fraction of the price. Hanwei enjoys considerable success among hobbyists (e.g. practitioners of Iaido) due to the prohibitive pricetag of "real" Japanese shinken and has moved into manufacturing models of Chinese and European swords as well, including typical specimens of a Viking sword, a knightly sword and a hand-and-a-half sword.

The 160 was designed by Seymour Cray - reportedly over a long three-day weekend. It fit into the desk where its operator sat.The 160 architecture uses ones' complement arithmetic with end-around carry.NCR joint-marketed the 160-A under its own name for several years in the 1960s.

VThe B-300 is a reusable man-portable anti-tank weapon system developed by Israel Military Industries in the late 1970s for use by the Israel Defense Forces. The B-300 can be carried and operated by a single operator and is effective to approximately 400 meters (1,312 ft). Pre-packaged munitions and simple operating mechanisms make the weapon quite versatile, permitting use by airborne, motorized, and ground troops alike. When defence publications first heard reports of the B-300 in the early 1980s, various reports stated in error that it was an Israeli improved and manufactured version of the Russian RPG-7.

VThe Meunier rifle evolved as a part of the program initiated in 1890 by the French military to develop a semi-automatic infantry rifle that would eventually replace the Mle 1886-93 Lebel rifle. Four government research establishments (STA, ENT, Puteaux and CTV) proposed over 20 prototypes. About half of them were based on recoil (both short recoil and long recoil) and the others were gas operated. This secret program was placed under the direction of General Naquet-Laroque who headed the Puteaux (APX) government arsenal.

VWang 2200, appeared in May 1973, was Wang Laboratories' first minicomputer that could perform data processing in a common computer language. Unlike some other desktop computers, such as the HP 9830, it had a cathode ray tube (CRT) in a cabinet that also included an integrated computer-controlled cassette tape storage unit and keyboard. Microcoded to run interpretive BASIC, about 65,000 systems were shipped in its lifetime and it found wide use in small and medium-size businesses worldwide. The 2200 evolved into a desktop computer and larger system to support up to 16 workstations and utilized commercial disk technologies that appeared in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The disk subsystems could be attached to up to 15 computers giving a theoretical upper limit of 240 workstations in a single cluster.Unlike the other product lines such as the VS and OIS, Wang Laboratories aggressively used value added resellers (VARs) to customize and market 2200 systems. One such creative solution deployed dozens of 2200 systems and was developed in conjunction with Hawaii- and Hong Kong-based firm, Algorithms, Inc. It provided paging (beeper) services for much of the Hong Kong market in the early 1980s.

VXperia Tablet (former code names Sony S1 and Sony S2), formerly known as Sony Tablet, is the brand name of a series of tablet computers. The first models used to run Google's operating system Android 3.1 Honeycomb, but more recent models operate on the Android 4.1.2 system. The first models were informally announced on 26 April 2011, using the code names, by the Sony Corporation in the Sony IT Mobile Meeting. They featured touchscreens, two cameras (a rear-facing 5 MP, a front-facing 0.3 MP), infrared sensor, Wi-Fi. Also, they support PlayStation Suite, DLNA, and are 3G/4G compatible. The retail price in the U.S at the time of release was US$499\u2013599. In Europe, prices were at \u20ac499. To increase the number of apps available and provide marketing support for both tablets, Sony and Adobe Systems will hold a $200,000 competition targeting app developers. The series was formally launched in Berlin and Tokyo on 31 August 2011. The series currently consists of the Sony Xperia Tablet S and the Sony Xperia Tablet Z, announced in 2013.

VThe Altair 8800 is a microcomputer designed in 1974 by MITS and based on the Intel 8080 CPU. Interest grew quickly after it was featured on the cover of the January 1975 issue (published in late November 1974) of Popular Electronics, and was sold by mail order through advertisements there, in Radio-Electronics, and in other hobbyist magazines. The designers hoped to sell a few hundred build-it-yourself kits to hobbyists, and were surprised when they sold thousands in the first month. The Altair also appealed to individuals and businesses that just wanted a computer and purchased the assembled version. The Altair is widely recognized as the spark that ignited the microcomputer revolution as the first commercially successful personal computer. The computer bus designed for the Altair was to become a de facto standard in the form of the S-100 bus, and the first programming language for the machine was Microsoft's founding product, Altair BASIC.

VThe Astrocade is a second generation home video game console and simple computer system designed by a team at Midway, at that time the videogame division of Bally. It was marketed only for a limited time before Bally decided to exit the market. The rights were later picked up by a third-party company, who re-released it and sold it until around 1984. The Astrocade is particularly notable for its very powerful graphics capabilities for the time of release, and for the difficulty in accessing those capabilities.

VThe P-64 is a Polish 9x18mm semi-automatic pistol designed to fire the 9×18mm Makarov cartridge. The pistol was developed in the late 1950s at the Institute for Artillery Research (Polish: Zak\u0142ad Broni Strzeleckiej Centralnego Badawczego Poligonu Artyleryjskiego, which later became the Military Institute of Armament Technology, Polish: Wojskowy Instytut Techniczny Uzbrojenia w Zielonce\u2014WITU) by a team consisting of: W. Czepukajtis, R. Zimny, H. Adamczyk, M. Adamczyk, S. Kaczmarski and J. Pyzel. The P-64 is also known as the CZAK (an acronym of the designers' last names with the exception of J. Pyzel, who joined the team after the name had been established).

VThe HB 876 mine was an air dropped area denial weapon. It was used as part of the JP233 runway denial system and the 'Hades' variant of the BL755 cluster bomb. As a result of the anti-personnel mine ban it was withdrawn from British Royal Air Force service, and the last stockpiles of the mine were destroyed on 19 October 1999.

VThe Toshiba T1000 was a laptop computer manufactured by the Toshiba Corporation in 1987. It had a similar specification to the IBM PC Convertible, with an 4.77 MHz 80C88 processor, 512 kB of RAM, and a monochrome CGA-compatible LCD. Unlike the Convertible, it includes a standard serial port and parallel port, connectors for an external monitor, and a real-time clock.Unusually for an IBM compatible PC, the T1000 contained a 256 kB ROM with a copy of MS-DOS 2.11. This acted as a small, read-only hard drive. Alternative operating systems could still be loaded from the floppy drive, or (if present) the ramdisk.Along with the earlier T1100 and T1200 systems, the Toshiba T1000 was one of the early computers to feature a "laptop" form factor and battery-powered operation.

VThe Pleter submachine gun is a submachine gun created in 1991, when the dissolution of Yugoslavia left Croatia with few weapons to arm their yet to be formed military in the midst of Croatian War of Independence. The embargo prevented the newly formed state from legally buying equipment abroad, the first choice was to try to design and produce some new weapons locally, mostly based on second generation of submachineguns (like STEN gun or MP40).The Pleter (named after the Slavonian town of Pleternica) was produced in the local factory OROPLET, heavily copied Sten Gun characteristics, despite having a vertical rather than horizontal magazine. These include the removable barrel assembly, the bolt and recoil spring, and the open bolt firing mechanism. Prototype models had handle and trigger pack cover made from wood, but in the serial production it was decided to use ones made from plastic. Barrel assembly was simplified compared to Sten gun, it was fixed by inbus screw, and to further simplify the construction, safety and fire selector was omitted. It was equipped with only simple sear/trigger/spring combination, making it open-bolt full auto only, but due to the relatively low rate of fire, skilled operator could fire single shots by quickly pulling and releasing the trigger.Moreover, just like the Sten, the Pleter could also be fitted with a silencer, and there was a special model made with permanently fixed silencer attached ( called "Pleter 91 Prigu\u0161en" = silenced )Fixed front and back sight that cannot be adjusted produced some criticism from the users. The magazine well was designed to accept the direct copy of Uzi magazine. This type of dual stack, dual feed type magazine is considered one of the improvements this gun has in comparison to the original STEN gun or similar ones that used dual stack, single feed magazines, that are often more prone to jamming and harder to load. The butt stock shape was apparently influenced by another similar gun of World War II vintage, the Grease Gun.Out of probably dozen domestically designed and produced submachine guns from the 1991. the Pleter proved to be quite good insurgency weapon, which somewhat filled in the gaps of the undergunned Croatian Army and was suitable for the combat environment of the Yugoslav Wars. Some examples may also have oozed into Kosovo to see action in the 1999 war. The exact number of the produced Pleter guns is not published, but the ones that were in the logistic reserves of the Croatian military were destroyed after the war in coordination with the military police, so today this gun only exists in small numbers.

VThe Steyr SSG 08 (German: Scharfschützengewehr 2008, English: Sniper Rifle 08) is a modern bolt action sniper rifle developed and produced by Steyr Mannlicher in Austria. The rifle is a further evolution of the SSG 04 sniper rifle, also developed and produced by Steyr.It is a highly accurate bolt action sniper rifle, with a folding stock and an adjustable cheek piece and butt plate. It is equipped with a bipod and a "butt spike" monopod for added stability. The pistol grip is customisable by changing the front and back straps. The rifle has a Picatinny rail for mounting optics. The rifle also features an improved muzzle brake over the SSG 04, with the ability to attach a suppressor. Introduced in 2008, Steyr claims EKO Cobra, Austria's primary counter-terrorism unit, had its hand in developing this weapon. The SSG 08 utilises the Safe Bolt System (SBS) action, cold hammer-forged barrels, trigger units and magazines of its parent, the SSG 04, but features an aluminium alloy stock, with side-folding, fully adjustable butt and additional Picatinny rails on the forend. The SSG 08 is advertised as capable of sub-MOA accuracy with proper ammunition.The SSG 08 is based on Steyr's SBS rotary bolt action with four frontal locking lugs, arranged in pairs. It also features free-floated, cold hammer-forged heavy barrels, which are available in 20 inch (.308 Winchester), 23.6 inch (.243 Winchester, .308 Winchester, .300 Winchester Magnum) and 27.2 inch (.338 Lapua Magnum) lengths. Feed is from detachable double-column box magazines, which hold ten .243 Winchester or .308 Winchester, eight .300 Winchester Magnum or six .338 Lapua Magnum rounds. The single-stage trigger is factory set for optimum performance, but can be adjusted by the user. It is not equipped with iron sights.

VThe HTC One (codenamed and retroactively called M7) is a touchscreen-based Android smartphone designed, developed, and manufactured by HTC. The smartphone was unveiled on 19 February 2013 at press events in New York City and London and is HTC\u2019s seventh flagship smartphone. It is the successor to the company\u2019s 2012 flagship model, the One X\u2014which was critically acclaimed, but commercially unsuccessful due in part to insufficient marketing efforts. To make the device stand out among its competition, the HTC One was developed with a major emphasis on unique hardware and software features; which included a unibody aluminum frame, a 1080p full-HD display, dual front-facing stereo speakers, a camera with a custom image sensor and the ability to automatically generate montages of media, an updated version of HTC\u2019s Sense user experience, BlinkFeed\u2014an aggregator of news and social network content, and an electronic program guide app with the ability to serve as a universal remote via an IR blaster located in the device\u2019s power button.Beginning in March 2013, the HTC One was made available to mobile operators and major retailers in at least 181 countries. Manufacturing delays led to a staggered release beginning in late March, with its release date in certain markets (such as Asia and North America) pushed to late-April. Nevertheless, with around 5 million units being sold during its first two months of worldwide availability, HTC stated that the One was the most successful launch in the company\u2019s history.The HTC One was praised for the quality of its industrial design, high-density 468 ppi display, and high-power 2.6W RMS stereo sound system, and was well-received for its overall performance and improved user experience in comparison to earlier HTC devices. However, some aspects of the device, such as its photo quality, battery life, and certain elements of the device's operating system, were subject to scrutiny by critics. The device has received numerous awards and accolades, including being named "Best New Mobile Device" by the GSM Association at Mobile World Congress 2013, and was named the best smartphone of 2013 at the same conference one year later. It was succeeded by the HTC One (M8) on 25 March 2014.

The Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge were released on 10 April 2015 in 20 countries while the S6 Edge+ was released on 21 August 2015 in 20 countries.Although the overall design of the Galaxy S6 still features some similarities to prior models, the construction of the device itself was revamped, with a metal unibody frame and glass backing instead of plastic. The devices also introduced an improved camera, a streamlined user interface, support for both major wireless charging standards, and support for a mobile payments platform that allows the device to emulate the magnetic strip from a credit card. The S6 features other hardware improvements as well, including a 1440p display, a new in-house system-on-chip that utilizes a 14 nm FinFET manufacturing process, and an improved fingerprint scanner.The Galaxy S6, S6 Edge and S6 Edge+ received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised the devices' upgraded build quality over prior models, along with improvements to their displays, performance, camera, and other changes. However, Samsung's decision to remove the ability to expand their storage or remove the battery was panned as being potentially alienating to power users, and the S6 Edge was also panned for not making enough use of its curved display to justify its increased cost over the standard Samsung Galaxy S6 which resulted into the release of the bigger S6 Edge+ later on.

VTrocano is a Brazilian thermobaric weapon similar in design to the United States' MOAB weapon or Russia's FOAB. Like the US weapon, the Trocano is designed to be pallet-loaded into a C-130 Hercules aircraft, and deployed using a parachute to drag it from the C-130's cargo bay and separate from its pallet, at which point the bomb's own aerodynamics determine its drop trajectory.The Trocano contains 9,000 kg of tritonal, producing a total destruction blast radius of 1 kilometre (0.62 mi). This places the Trocano above the blast yield of the US weapon (containing 8,150 kg of explosive) and second only to the Russian weapon (with 11,000 kg).

VThe AK-47 (also known as the Kalashnikov, AK, or in Russian slang, Kalash) is a selective-fire (semi-automatic and automatic), gas-operated 7.62×39 mm assault rifle, developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov. It is officially known in the Soviet documentation as Avtomat Kalashnikova (Russian: \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442 \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0448\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430).Design work on the AK-47 began in the last year of World War II (1945). In 1946, the AK-47 was presented for official military trials, and in 1948, the fixed-stock version was introduced into active service with selected units of the Soviet Army. An early development of the design was the AKS (S\u2014Skladnoy or "folding"), which was equipped with an underfolding metal shoulder stock. In 1949, the AK-47 was officially accepted by the Soviet Armed Forces and used by the majority of the member states of the Warsaw Pact.Even after almost seven decades, the model and its variants remain the most popular and widely used assault rifles in the world because of their substantial reliability under harsh conditions, low production costs compared to contemporary Western weapons, availability in virtually every geographic region and ease of use. The AK-47 has been manufactured in many countries and has seen service with armed forces as well as irregular forces worldwide, and was the basis for developing many other types of individual and crew-served firearms. As of 2004..."Of the estimated 500 million firearms worldwide, approximately 100 million belong to the Kalashnikov family, three-quarters of which are AK-47s".

VThe Acorn Business Computer (ABC) was a series of microcomputers announced at the end of 1983 by the British company Acorn Computers. The series of eight computers was aimed at the business, research and further education markets. However, the ABC range was cancelled before any of the models were shipped to customers. The ABC 210 was subsequently relaunched as the Acorn Cambridge Workstation, sold in modest numbers to academic and scientific users.The ABC range was developed by Acorn essentially as a repackaged BBC Micro, expanded to 64 KB RAM, to which was added (in some models) a second processor and extra memory to complement the Micro's 6502. The electronics and disk drives were integrated into the monitor housing, with a separate keyboard.The Zilog Z80, Intel 80286 and National Semiconductor 32016 were all used as second processors in the various models. Two of the eight models produced, the Personal Assistant and the Terminal, had no second processor.

VThe Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by Commodore in the 1980s and 1990s. Based on the Motorola 68000 family of microprocessors, the machine has a custom chipset with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from earlier 8-bit home computers, including Commodore's own C64.The Amiga 1000 was officially released in July 1985, but a series of production problems meant it did not become widely available until early 1986. The best selling model, the Amiga 500, was introduced in 1987 and became one of the leading home computers of the late 1980s and early 1990s with four to six million sold. The A3000, introduced in 1990, started the second generation of Amiga systems, followed by the A500+ and the A600. Finally, as the third generation, the A1200 and the A4000 were released in 1992. The platform became particularly popular for gaming and programming demos. It also found a prominent role in the desktop video, video production, and show control business, leading to affordable video editing systems such as the Video Toaster. The Amiga's native ability to simultaneously play back multiple digital sound samples made it a popular platform for early "tracker" music software. The relatively powerful processor and ability to access several megabytes of memory led to the development of several 3D rendering packages, including LightWave 3D, Imagine, Aladdin4D, and TurboSilver.Although early Commodore advertisements attempt to cast the computer as an all-purpose business machine, especially when outfitted with the Amiga Sidecar PC compatibility addon, the Amiga was most commercially successful as a home computer, with a wide range of games and creative software. It was also a less expensive alternative to the Apple Macintosh and IBM PC as a general-purpose business or home computer. Initially, the Amiga was developed alongside various Commodore PC clones, but Commodore later left the PC market. Poor marketing and the failure of the later models to repeat the technological advances of the first systems meant that the Amiga quickly lost its market share to competing platforms, such as the fourth generation game consoles, Apple Macintosh, and later IBM PC compatibles. Commodore ultimately went bankrupt in April 1994 after the "make or break" Amiga CD32 model failed in the marketplace.Since the demise of Commodore, various groups have marketed successors to the original Amiga line, including Genesi, Eyetech, ACube Systems Srl and A-EON Technology. Likewise, AmigaOS has influenced replacements, clones and compatible systems such as MorphOS, AmigaOS 4 and AROS. The demise of Commodore has been commonly attributed to numerous factors such as poor marketing, a lack of sufficient third party developers, and a failure to compete with cheaper PC clones with "multimedia" features and low-cost color-capable Macintosh models such as the Macintosh LC.

VApple Computer 1, also known later as the Apple I, or Apple-1, was released by the Apple Computer Company (now Apple Inc.) in 1976. It was designed and hand-built by Steve Wozniak. Wozniak's friend Steve Jobs had the idea of selling the computer. The Apple I was Apple's first product, and to finance its creation, Jobs sold his only means of transportation, a VW Microbus, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for $500. It was demonstrated in July 1976 at the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto, California.

VApple Computer 1, also known later as the Apple I, or Apple-1, is a desktop computer released by the Apple Computer Company (now Apple Inc.) in 1976. It was designed and hand-built by Steve Wozniak. Wozniak's friend Steve Jobs had the idea of selling the computer. The Apple I was Apple's first product, and to finance its creation, Jobs sold his only motorized means of transportation, a VW Microbus, for a few hundred dollars, and Wozniak sold his HP-65 calculator for $500; however, Wozniak said that Jobs planned to use his bicycle if necessary. It was demonstrated in July 1976 at the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto, California.Production was discontinued on September 30, 1977, after the June 10, 1977, introduction of its successor, the Apple II, which Byte magazine referred to as part of the "1977 Trinity" of personal computing (along with the PET 2001 and the TRS-80).

VThe Apple II (stylized as apple ][) is an 8-bit home computer, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products, designed primarily by Steve Wozniak (Steve Jobs oversaw the development of the Apple II's foam-molded plastic case and Rod Holt developed the switching power supply). It was introduced in 1977 at the West Coast Computer Faire by Jobs and was the first consumer product sold by Apple Computer. It is the first model in a series of computers which were produced until Apple IIe production ceased in November 1993.

VThe Apple III (often styled as Apple ///) is a business-oriented personal computer produced and released by Apple Computer that was intended as the successor to the Apple II series, but was largely considered a failure in the market. Development work on the Apple III started in late 1978 under the guidance of Dr. Wendell Sander. It had the internal code name of "Sara", named after Sander's daughter. The machine was first announced and released on May 19, 1980, but due to serious stability issues that required a design overhaul and a recall of existing machines, it was formally reintroduced in the second half of 1981. Development stopped and the Apple III was discontinued on April 24, 1984, and its last successor\u2014the III Plus, was dropped from the Apple product line in September 1985.The Apple III could be viewed as an enhanced Apple II \u2013 then the newest heir to a line of 8-bit machines dating back to 1976. However, the Apple III was not part of the Apple II line, but rather a close cousin. The key features business users wanted in a personal computer were a true typewriter-style upper/lowercase keyboard (as opposed to the Apple II, which only supported uppercase letters) and 80-column display. In addition, the machine had to pass U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) radio frequency interference (RFI) qualifications for business equipment. In 1981, International Business Machines (IBM) unveiled the IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) \u2013 a completely new 16-bit design soon available in a wide range of inexpensive clones. The business market moved rapidly towards the PC DOS/MS-DOS platform, eventually pulling away from the Apple 8-bit computer line.Despite numerous stability issues and a recall that included the first 14,000 units off the assembly line, Apple was eventually able to produce a reliable and dependable version of the machine. However, damage to the computer's reputation had already been done and it failed to do well commercially as a direct result. In the end, an estimated 65,000\u201375,000 Apple III computers were sold. The Apple III Plus brought this up to ~120,000. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak stated that the primary reason for the Apple III's failure was that the system was designed by Apple's marketing department, unlike Apple's previous engineering-driven projects. The Apple III's failure led to Apple reevaluating their plan to phase out the Apple II, and eventual continuation of development of the older machine. As a result, later Apple II models incorporated some hardware, such as the Apple Scribe Printer, a thermal printer, and software technologies of the Apple III.

VApple TV (stylized as tv) is a digital media player and a microconsole developed and sold by Apple Inc. It is a small network appliance and entertainment device that can receive digital data from a number of sources and stream it to a capable television.Apple TV is an HDMI-compliant source device. To use it for viewing, it has to be connected to an enhanced-definition or high-definition widescreen television via an HDMI cable. The device has no integrated controls and can only be controlled externally, either by an Apple Remote control device (with which it is shipped) using its infrared capability, by the iTunes Remote app (downloadable from App Store) on iOS devices, such as the iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, and Apple Watch, using its Wi-Fi capability, or by some third-party infrared remotes.Its Wi-Fi capability is also used to receive digital content from the iTunes app using AirPlay or directly from iTunes Store, which is then streamed to the TV. It also plays digital content from the iTunes Store, Netflix, Hulu Plus, Now TV (UK only), YouTube and Vevo, Showtime Anytime along with the TV Everywhere portals of several cable and broadcast networks, and the video subscription portals of three of the four major North American sports leagues: MLB.tv, NBA League Pass and NHL.tv. It plays content from any macOS or Windows computer running iTunes. Apple began to promote the Live Tune-In feature that allows the viewer to ask Siri to tune to live streams of CBS, ESPN, and Disney XD among others that support Live Tune-In.NBCUniversal released a trio of applications to the tvOS App Store on May 27, 2016, enabling those with a satellite, cable or fiber television login to watch live and on-demand content via the Syfy, E!, Telemundo and Bravo applications with their Apple TV. The NBCUniversal applications give access to full seasons of the networks' most popular series, with current and past episodes of all series. NBCUniversal previously made NBC, USA, NBC Sports, and CNBC applications available for download and with the addition of the four new channels, it brings seven of NBCUniversal's networks to Apple TV users.

VThe Apple Watch (marketed stylized as WATCH) is a smartwatch developed by Apple Inc. It incorporates fitness tracking and health-oriented capabilities with integration with iOS and other Apple products and services. The device is available in four variants: Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch, Apple Watch Hermès, and Apple Watch Edition. The Watch is distinguished by different combinations of cases and first or third party interchangeable bands. Apple Watch relies on a wirelessly connected iPhone to perform many of its default functions such as calling and texting. It is compatible with the iPhone 5 or later models running iOS 8.2 or later, through the use of Bluetooth. Announced by Tim Cook on September 9, 2014, the device was available for pre-order on April 10 and began shipping on April 24, 2015. The Apple Watch quickly became the best-selling wearable device with the shipment of 4.2 million smartwatches in the second quarter of the 2015 fiscal year.

VThe Atari 2600 (or Atari VCS before 1982) is a home video game console released on September 11, 1977 by Atari, Inc. It is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F video game console in 1976. This format contrasts with the older model of having non-microprocessor dedicated hardware, which could only play the games which were physically built into the unit.The console was originally sold as the Atari VCS, an abbreviation for Video Computer System. Following the release of the Atari 5200 in 1982, the VCS was renamed to the "Atari 2600", after the unit's Atari part number, CX2600. The 2600 was typically bundled with two joystick controllers, a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, and a game cartridge: initially Combat, and later Pac-Man.

VThe Atari Jaguar is a home video game console that was developed by Atari Corporation. The console was the sixth and last programmable console to be developed under the Atari brand, originally released in North America in November 1993. Controversially, Atari marketed the Jaguar as being the first 64-bit video game console, while competing with the existing 16-bit consoles (Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System) and the 32-bit 3DO Interactive Multiplayer platform (which launched the same year).Development on the Atari Jaguar started in the early 1990s, and was designed by Flare Technology, who were tasked by Atari to create two consoles; the Atari Panther, which would compete with the Genesis and the Super NES, and a successor, the Jaguar, which would surpass the capabilities of any other console on the market at the time. With development of the Jaguar running ahead of schedule, the Panther was cancelled, and the release of the Jaguar was pushed forward. It was originally released to test markets in New York City and San Francisco in November 1993, and to the general public in 1994, with Cybermorph as the pack-in launch game.The console's multi-chip architecture made game development for the console difficult, and underwhelming sales further contributed to the console's lack of third party support.

VThe Atari Jaguar is a home video game console that was developed by Atari Corporation. The console was the sixth and last programmable console to be developed under the Atari brand, originally released in North America in November 1993. Controversially, Atari marketed the Jaguar as being the first 64-bit video game console, while competing with the existing 16-bit consoles (Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System) and the 32-bit 3DO Interactive Multiplayer platform (which launched the same year).Development on the Atari Jaguar started in the early 1990s, and was designed by Flare Technology, who were tasked by Atari to create two consoles; the Atari Panther, which would compete with the Genesis and the Super NES, and a successor, the Jaguar, which would surpass the capabilities of any other console on the market at the time. With development of the Jaguar running ahead of schedule, the Panther was cancelled, and the release of the Jaguar was pushed forward. It was originally released to test markets in New York City and San Francisco in November 1993, and to the general public in 1994, with Cybermorph as the pack-in launch game.The console's multi-chip architecture made game development for the console difficult, and underwhelming sales further contributed to the console's lack of third party support.

VThe Atari Lynx is an 8-bit handheld game console that was released by Atari Corporation in October 1989 in North America, and in Europe and Japan in 1990. The Lynx holds the distinction of being the world's first handheld electronic game with a color LCD. The system is also notable for its forward-looking features, advanced graphics, and ambidextrous layout. The Lynx competed with the Game Boy (released just 2 months earlier), as well as the Game Gear and TurboExpress, both released the following year.

VThe Atari ST is a line of home computers from Atari Corporation and the successor to the Atari 8-bit family. The first ST model, the 520ST, was released in June 1985. "ST" officially stands for "Sixteen/Thirty-two", which referred to the Motorola 68000's 16-bit external bus and 32-bit internals. The Atari ST is the first personal computer to come with a bit-mapped color GUI, using a version of Digital Research's GEM released in February 1985. The 1040ST, released in 1986, is the first personal computer to ship with a megabyte of RAM in the base configuration and also the first with a cost-per-kilobyte of less than US$1.The Atari ST is part of a mid-1980s generation of home computers that have 16 or 32-bit processors, 256 KB or more of RAM, and mouse-controlled graphical user interfaces. It includes the Macintosh, Commodore Amiga, Apple IIGS, and, in certain markets, the Acorn Archimedes. The Amiga and Atari ST both use the Motorola 68000, but whereas the Amiga has custom graphics processors and sample-based synthesis audio, the ST has a basic frame buffer and a three-voice synthesizer chip but with a slightly faster CPU and a high-resolution monochrome display mode ideal for business and CAD. Its simpler design allowed the ST to precede the Amiga's release by almost two months and at a lower price.In some markets, particularly Germany, the machine gained a strong foothold as a small business machine for CAD and desktop publishing work.Thanks to its built-in MIDI, the ST enjoyed success for running music-sequencer software and as a controller of musical instruments among both amateurs and well-known musicians.The ST was later superseded by the Atari STE, Atari TT, Atari MEGA STE, and Falcon computers.

VThe KiddiComp concept, envisioned by Alan Kay in 1968, while a PhD candidate and later developed and described as the Dynabook in his 1972 proposal A personal computer for children of all ages, outlines the requirements for a conceptual portable educational device that would offer similar functionality to that now supplied via a laptop computer or (in some of its other incarnations) a tablet or slate computer with the exception of the requirement for any Dynabook device offering near eternal battery life. Adults could also use a Dynabook, but the target audience was children.Part of the motivation and funding for the Dynabook project came from the need for portable military maintenance, repair, and operations documentation. Eliminating the need to move large amounts of difficult-to-access paper in a dynamic military theatre provided significant US Department of Defense funding.Though the hardware required to create a Dynabook is here today, Alan Kay still thinks the Dynabook hasn't been invented yet, because key software and educational curricula are missing. When Microsoft came up with its tablet PC, Kay was quoted as saying "Microsoft's Tablet PC, the first Dynabook-like computer good enough to criticize". A comment he had earlier applied to the Apple Macintosh.Toshiba also has a line of sub-notebook computers called DynaBooks.

The user interface is built around the device's multi-touch screen, including a virtual keyboard. The iPad includes built-in Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity on select models. As of January 2015, there have been over 250 million iPads sold. IPad tablets are second most popular, by sales, against Android-based ones, since 2013, when Android tablet sales increased by 127%.An iPad can shoot video, take photos, play music, and perform Internet functions such as web-browsing and emailing. Other functions \u2013  games, reference, GPS navigation, social networking, etc. \u2013  can be enabled by downloading and installing apps. As of October 2013, the App Store has more than 475,000 native apps by Apple and third parties.There have been six versions of the iPad. The first generation established design precedents, such as the 9.7-inch screen size and button placement, that have persisted through all models. The 2nd generation iPad (iPad 2) introduced a whole new design which also added a dual-core Apple A5 processor and VGA front-facing and 720p rear-facing cameras designed for FaceTime video calling, and dramatically reduced the thickness of the device. The third generation added a Retina Display, the new Apple A5X processor with a quad-core graphics processor, a 5-megapixel camera, HD 1080p video recording, voice dictation, and 4G (LTE). The fourth generation added the Apple A6X processor and replaces the 30-pin connector with an all-digital Lightning connector. The iPad Air added the Apple A7 processor and the Apple M7 motion coprocessor, and reduced the thickness for the first time since the iPad 2. The iPad Air 2 added the Apple A8X processor, the Apple M8 motion coprocessor, an 8-megapixel camera, and the Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and further reduced the thickness.There have been four versions of the iPad Mini. The first generation features a reduced screen size of 7.9 inches and features similar internal specifications as the iPad 2 except it uses the Lightning connector. The iPad Mini 2 features the Retina Display, the Apple A7 processor and the Apple M7 motion coprocessor, closely matching the internals specifications of the iPad Air. The iPad Mini 3 features the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. The iPad Mini 4 features the Apple A8 and the Apple M8 motion coprocessor.

VThe iPod is a line of portable media players and multi-purpose pocket computers designed and marketed by Apple Inc. The first version was released on October 23, 2001, about 8½ months after iTunes (Macintosh version) was released. The most recent iPod redesigns were announced on July 15, 2015. There are three current versions of the iPod: the ultra-compact iPod Shuffle, the compact iPod Nano and the touchscreen iPod Touch.Like other digital music players, iPods can serve as external data storage devices. Storage capacity varies by model, ranging from 2 GB for the iPod Shuffle to 128 GB for the iPod Touch (previously 160 GB for the iPod Classic, which is now discontinued).Apple's iTunes software (and other alternative software) can be used to transfer music, photos, videos, games, contact information, e-mail settings, Web bookmarks, and calendars, to the devices supporting these features from computers using certain versions of Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows operating systems.Before the release of iOS 5, the iPod branding was used for the media player included with the iPhone and iPad, a combination of the Music and Videos apps on the iPod Touch. As of iOS 5, separate apps named "Music" and "Videos" are standardized across all iOS-powered products. While the iPhone and iPad have essentially the same media player capabilities as the iPod line, they are generally treated as separate products. During the middle of 2010, iPhone sales overtook those of the iPod.In mid-2015, a new model of the iPod Touch was announced by Apple, and was officially released on the Apple store on July 15, 2015. The sixth generation iPod Touch includes a wide variety of spec improvements such as the upgraded A8 processor and higher-quality screen. The core is over 5 times faster than previous models and is built to be roughly on par with the iPhone 5S. It is available in 5 different colors: Space grey, pink, gold, silver and Product (red).

VThe Macintosh (/\u02c8mæk\u1d7bnt\u0252\u0283/ MAK-in-tosh; (branded as Mac since 1998) is a series of personal computers (PCs) designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. Steve Jobs introduced the original Macintosh computer on January 10, 1984. This was the company's first mass-market personal computer featuring an integral graphical user interface and mouse. This first model was later renamed to "Macintosh 128k" for uniqueness amongst a populous family of subsequently updated models which are also based on Apple's same proprietary architecture. Since 1998, Apple has largely phased out the Macintosh name in favor of "Mac", though the product family has been nicknamed "Mac" or "the Mac" since the development of the first model.The Macintosh, however, was expensive, which hindered its ability to be competitive in a market already dominated by the Commodore 64 for consumers, as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses. Macintosh systems still found success in education and desktop publishing and kept Apple as the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade. In the 1990s, improvements in the rival Wintel platform, notably with the introduction of Windows 3.0, then Windows 95, gradually took market share from the more expensive Macintosh systems. The performance advantage of 68000-based Macintosh systems was eroded by Intel's Pentium, and in 1994 Apple was relegated to third place as Compaq became the top PC manufacturer. Even after a transition to the superior PowerPC-based Power Macintosh (later renamed the PowerMac, in line with the PowerBook series) line in 1994, the falling prices of commodity PC components and the release of Windows 95 saw the Macintosh user base decline.In 1998, after the return of Steve Jobs, Apple consolidated its multiple consumer-level desktop models into the all-in-one iMac G3, which became a commercial success and revitalized the brand. Since their transition to Intel processors in 2006, the complete lineup is entirely based on said processors and associated systems. Its current lineup comprises three desktops (the all-in-one iMac, entry-level Mac mini, and the Mac Pro graphics workstation), and four laptops (the MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and MacBook Pro with Retina display). Its Xserve server was discontinued in 2011 in favor of the Mac Mini and Mac Pro.Apple also develops the operating system for the Mac, currently OS X version 10.11 "El Capitan". Macs are currently capable of running non-Apple operating systems such as Linux, OpenBSD, and Microsoft Windows with the aid of Boot Camp or third-party software. Apple does not license OS X for use on non-Apple computers, though it did license previous versions of Mac OS through their Macintosh clone program from 1995 to 1997.

VThe High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), commonly known as the Humvee, is a four-wheel drive military light truck produced by AM General. It has largely supplanted the roles originally performed by the original jeep, and others such as the Vietnam-era M151 jeep, the M561 "Gama Goat", their M718A1 and M792 ambulance versions, the Commercial Utility Cargo Vehicle (CUCV), and other light trucks. Primarily used by the United States military, it is also used by numerous other countries and organizations and even in civilian adaptations. The Humvee's widespread use in the Persian Gulf War, where it negotiated the treacherous desert sand with ease, helped inspire the civilian Hummer automotive marque.

VThe Hyperion is an early portable computer that vied with the Compaq Portable to be the first portable IBM PC compatible. It was marketed by Infotech Cie of Ottawa, a subsidiary of Bytec Management Corp., who acquired the designer and manufacturer Dynalogic in January 1983. In 1984 the design was licensed by Commodore International in a move that was forecast as a "radical shift of position" and a signal that Commodore would soon dominate the PC compatible market. Despite computers being "hand-assembled from kits" provided by Bytec and displayed alongside the Commodore 900 at a German trade show as their forthcoming first portable computer, it was never sold by Commodore and some analysts downplayed the pact. The Hyperion was shipped in January 1983 at C$4995, two months ahead of the Compaq Portable.

Released on April 3, 1986, the Convertible was also the first IBM computer to use the 3.5" floppy disk which went on to become the industry standard. Like modern laptops, it featured power management and the ability to run from batteries.It was the follow-up to the IBM Portable and was model number 5140. It was replaced in 1991 by the IBM PS/2 L40 SX, and in Japan by the IBM Personal System/55note, which was the predecessor to the ThinkPad.

VThe IBM Personal Computer, commonly known as the IBM PC, is the original version and progenitor of the IBM PC compatible hardware platform. It is IBM model number 5150, and was introduced on August 12, 1981. It was created by a team of engineers and designers under the direction of Don Estridge of the IBM Entry Systems Division in Boca Raton, Florida.The generic term "personal computer" was in use before 1981, applied as early as 1972 to the Xerox PARC's Alto, but because of the success of the IBM Personal Computer, the term "PC" came to mean more specifically a desktop microcomputer compatible with IBM's PC products. Within a short time of the introduction, third-party suppliers of peripheral devices, expansion cards, and software proliferated; the influence of the IBM PC on the personal computer market was substantial in standardizing a platform for personal computers. "IBM compatible" became an important criterion for sales growth; only the Apple Macintosh family kept significant market share without compatibility with the IBM personal computer.

The name AT stood for "Advanced Technology", and was chosen because the AT offered various technologies that were then new in personal computers; one such advancement was that the 80286 processor supported protected mode. IBM later released an 8 MHz version of the AT.

It was released as IBM Machine Type number 5160 on March 8, 1983. Apart from the hard drive, it was essentially the same as the original PC, with only minor improvements. The XT was mainly intended as an enhanced IBM PC for business users. Later floppy-only models would effectively replace the original model 5150 PC. A corresponding 3270 PC featuring 3270 terminal emulation was released later in October 1983. XT stands for eXtended Technology.

VThe IBM Portable Personal Computer 5155 model 68 was an early portable computer developed by IBM after the success of Compaq's suitcase-size portable machine (the Compaq Portable). It was released in February, 1984, and was eventually replaced by the IBM Convertible.The Portable was basically a PC/XT motherboard, transplanted into a Compaq-style luggable case. The system featured 256 kilobytes of memory (expandable to 512 kB on the motherboard), an added CGA card connected to an internal monochrome amber composite monitor, and one or two half-height 5¼" 360 kB floppy disk drives. Unlike the Compaq Portable, which used a dual-mode monitor and special display card, IBM used a stock CGA card and a 9" amber monochrome composite monitor, which had lower resolution. It could, however, display color if connected to an external monitor or television. A separate 83-key keyboard and cable was provided.If a bit less sophisticated than the Compaq Portable, IBM's machine had the advantage of a lower price tag. The motherboard had eight expansion slots. The power supply was rated 114 watts and was suitable for operation on either 120 or 230 VAC. Hard disks were a very common third-party add-on as IBM did not offer them from the factory. Typically in a two-drive context, floppy drive A: ran the operating system, and drive B: would be used for application and data diskettes.Its selling point as a "portable" was that it combined the monitor into a base unit approximating a medium-sized suitcase that could be simply set on its flat side, plugged in, the keyboard folded down or detached, and booted up for use, though printers at the time, if needed, still tended to be less "portable".

VThe System/23 Datamaster (Model 5322) was announced by IBM in July 1981.The Datamaster was an all-in-one computer with text-mode CRT display, keyboard, processor, memory, and two 8-inch floppy disk drives in one cabinet. The processor was an 8-bit Intel 8085, with bank switching to manage 256 kB of memory. The intention of the Datamaster was to provide a computer that could be installed and operated without specialists.A BASIC interpreter was built-in; merging its BASIC with the one for the System/34 reportedly delayed the Datamaster by almost a year. When introduced, a single-screen Datamaster sold for around US$9,000 (equivalent to $23,426 in 2015)). A second keyboard and screen could be attached in an extended configuration.The familiarity of the design group gained on the Datamaster project encouraged selection of an Intel CPU for the IBM PC, announced one month after the Datamaster. The delay from the BASIC encouraged IBM's selection of Microsoft BASIC for the PC.

VThe Intellivision is a home video game console released by Mattel Electronics in 1979. Development of the console began in 1978, less than a year after the introduction of its main competitor, the Atari 2600. The word intellivision is a portmanteau of "intelligent television". Over 3 million Intellivision units were sold and a total of 125 games were released for the console.In 2009, video game website IGN named the Intellivision the No. 14 greatest video game console of all time. It remained Mattel's only video game console until the release of the HyperScan in 2006.

VThe Iron Duke Pontiac engine VIN code A (also called the 2500, 151, Pontiac 2.5, and Tech IV, though the decal on the air filter assemblies actually reads "4 Tech") is a 2.5 L (150.8 cu in) I4 piston engine. All Iron Dukes were built by Pontiac beginning in 1977 and ending in 1993. After this time, the GM 2.2 L OHV 4-cylinder replaced it across the entire lineup of vehicles that offered it. This engine is not to be confused with the Chevrolet 153. Early Iron Dukes had a Chevrolet V8 bellhousing (also shared with its third generation inline six) instead of the Buick-Oldsmobile-Pontiac bellhousing bolt pattern until the early 1980s when the later versions were installed in FWD applications where the 2.8L bellhousing bolt pattern was phased in. Cylinder head design had the intake manifold mounted on the passenger side, and the exhaust manifold on the driver side.This 151 was also used by American Motors (AMC) starting in 1980, as the base engine option in the RWD Spirit and Concord, and continuing in both cars through 1982. The AWD (4x4) Eagle carried the 151 as standard equipment for 1981, and carried it midway through the 1983 model year. It was also available (as the Hurricane) in economy model Jeep CJs. AMC replaced the Iron Duke 2.5L I4 with a 150cid Inline-4 derived from their own six.Applications:1977 Pontiac Astre1977-1979 Pontiac Phoenix1977\u20131980 Pontiac Sunbird1978\u20131980 Chevrolet Monza, Oldsmobile Starfire1980\u20131982 AMC Concord1980\u20131982 AMC Spirit1980\u20131983 Jeep CJ1980\u20131984 Oldsmobile Omega, Pontiac Phoenix1980\u20131985 Buick Skylark, Chevrolet Citation1981\u20131983 AMC Eagle1982\u20131984 Chevrolet Camaro, Pontiac Firebird1982\u20131989 Chevrolet Celebrity1982\u20131991 Pontiac 60001982\u20131992 Buick Century, Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera1984\u20131988 Pontiac Fiero1985\u20131987 Chevrolet S-10 Blazer, GMC S-15 Jimmy1985\u20131993 Chevrolet S-10, GMC S-15/Sonoma1985\u20131990 Chevrolet Astro, GMC Safari1985\u20131987 Buick Somerset1985\u20131991 Pontiac Grand Am, Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais1986\u20131991 Buick Skylark1987\u20131994 Grumman LLV (USPS delivery vehicle)1990\u20131992 Chevrolet Lumina

VThe Nintendo 64 (Japanese: \u30cb\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3\u30c9\u30fc64, Hepburn: Nintend\u014d Rokuj\u016byon), stylized as NINTENDO64 and often referred to as N64, is Nintendo's third home video game console for the international market. Named for its 64-bit central processing unit, it was released in June 1996 in Japan, September 1996 in North America, March 1997 in Europe and Australia, September 1997 in France and December 1997 in Brazil. It is the industry's last major home console to use the cartridge as its primary storage format, although current handheld systems (such as the PlayStation Vita and Nintendo 3DS) also use cartridges. While the Nintendo 64 was succeeded by Nintendo's MiniDVD-based GameCube in November 2001, the consoles remained available until the system was retired in late 2003.Code named Project Reality, the console's design was mostly finalized by mid-1995, though Nintendo 64's launch was delayed until 1996. As part of the fifth generation of gaming, the system competed primarily with the PlayStation and the Sega Saturn. The Nintendo 64 was launched with three games: Super Mario 64 and Pilotwings 64, released worldwide; and Saiky\u014d Habu Sh\u014dgi, released only in Japan. The Nintendo 64's suggested retail price at launch was US$199.99 and it was later marketed with the slogan "Get N, or get Out!". With 32.93 million units worldwide, the console was ultimately released in a range of different colors and designs, and an assortment of limited-edition controllers were sold or used as contest prizes during the system's lifespan. IGN named it the 9th greatest video game console of all time; and in 1996, Time Magazine named it Machine of the Year.

The console was released on 3 December 1994 in Japan, 9 September 1995 in North America, 29 September 1995 in Europe, 15 November 1995 in Australia, and for Korea in 1996. The console was the first of the PlayStation lineup of home video game consoles. It primarily competed with the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn as part of the fifth generation of video game consoles.The PlayStation is the first "computer entertainment platform" to ship 100 million units, which it had reached 9 years and 6 months after its initial launch. Microsoft chairman, Bill Gates, preferred Sony's console over the competition from Sega's Saturn, saying "our game designer likes the Sony machine". In 2000, a redesigned, slim version called the PSone was released, replacing the original grey console and named appropriately to avoid confusion with its successor, the PlayStation 2.In 1999, Sony announced the successor to the PlayStation, the PlayStation 2, which is backwards compatible with the PlayStation's DualShock controller and games, and launched the console in 2000. The last PSone units were sold in winter 2004 before it was officially discontinued in March 2005, for a total of 102 million units shipped since its launch 10 years earlier. Games for the PlayStation continued to sell until Sony ceased production of PlayStation games on 23 March 2006 \u2013 over 11 years after it had been released, and less than a year before the debut of the PlayStation 3.

VThe Sega Saturn (\u30bb\u30ac\u30b5\u30bf\u30fc\u30f3, Sega Sat\u0101n) is a 32-bit fifth-generation home video game console that was developed by Sega and released on November 22, 1994 in Japan, May 11, 1995 in North America, and July 8, 1995 in Europe as the successor to the successful Sega Genesis. The Saturn has a dual-CPU architecture and eight processors. Its games are in CD-ROM format, and its game library contains several arcade ports as well as original titles.Development of the Saturn began in 1992, the same year Sega's groundbreaking 3D Model 1 arcade hardware debuted. Designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company Hitachi, another video display processor was incorporated into the system's design in early 1994 to better compete with Sony's forthcoming PlayStation. The Saturn was initially successful in Japan, but failed to sell in large numbers in the United States after its surprise May 1995 launch, four months before its scheduled release date. After the debut of the Nintendo 64 in late 1996, the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the U.S., where it was discontinued in 1998. Having sold 9.26 million units worldwide, the Saturn is considered a commercial failure. The failure of Sega's development teams to release a game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, known in development as Sonic X-treme, has been considered a factor in the console's poor performance.Although the system is remembered for several well-regarded games, including Nights into Dreams..., the Panzer Dragoon series, and the Virtua Fighter series, the Saturn's reputation is mixed due to its complex hardware design and limited third-party support. Sega's management has been criticized for its decision-making during the system's development and cancellation.

VThe Xbox 360 is a home video game console developed by Microsoft. As the successor to the original Xbox, it is the second console in the Xbox series. The Xbox 360 competed with Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles. The Xbox 360 was officially unveiled on MTV on May 12, 2005, with detailed launch and game information divulged later that month at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3).The Xbox 360 features an online service, Xbox Live, which was expanded from its previous iteration on the original Xbox and received regular updates during the console's lifetime. Available in free and subscription-based varieties, Xbox Live allows users to: play games online; download games (through Xbox Live Arcade) and game demos; purchase and stream music, television programs, and films through the Xbox Music and Xbox Video portals; and access third-party content services through media streaming applications. In addition to online multimedia features, the Xbox 360 allows users to stream media from local PCs. Several peripherals have been released, including wireless controllers, expanded hard drive storage, and the Kinect motion sensing camera. The release of these additional services and peripherals helped the Xbox brand grow from gaming-only to encompassing all multimedia, turning it into a hub for living-room computing entertainment.Launched worldwide across 2005\u20132006, the Xbox 360 was initially in short supply in many regions, including North America and Europe. The earliest versions of the console suffered from a high failure rate, indicated by the so-called "Red Ring of Death", necessitating an extension of the device's warranty period. Microsoft released two redesigned models of the console: the Xbox 360 S in 2010, and the Xbox 360 E in 2013. As of June 2014, 84 million Xbox 360 consoles have been sold worldwide, making it the sixth-highest-selling video game console in history, and the highest-selling console made by an American company. Although not the best-selling console of its generation, the Xbox 360 was deemed by TechRadar to be the most influential through its emphasis on digital media distribution and multiplayer gaming on Xbox Live.The Xbox 360's successor, the Xbox One, was released on November 22, 2013. On April 20, 2016, Microsoft announced that it would end the production of new Xbox 360 hardware, although the company will continue to support the platform.

VThe Xbox One is a home video game console developed by Microsoft. Announced in May 2013, it is the successor to the Xbox 360 and the third console in the Xbox family, and was released in North America, Europe (in some countries), Australia, and Brazil in November 2013, and in Japan, China, and for other Europe countries in September 2014. It competes with Sony's PlayStation 4 and Nintendo's Wii U as part of the eighth generation of video game consoles. It is the first Xbox game console to be released in China, specifically in the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone. Microsoft marketed the device as an "all-in-one entertainment system", which competed against other digital media players, such as the Apple TV and Google TV platforms.Moving away from its predecessor's PowerPC-based architecture, the Xbox One marks a shift back to the x86 architecture used in the original Xbox; it features an AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) built around the x86-64 instruction set. The console places an increased emphasis on cloud computing and the integration of entertainment applications and services, offering the ability to overlay live television programming from an existing set-top box or a digital tuner for digital terrestrial television with an enhanced program guide, split-screen multitasking of applications, and improved second-screen support. The console optionally includes a redesigned Kinect sensor, marketed as the "Kinect 2.0", providing improved motion tracking and voice recognition for use in its graphical user interface (GUI) and games. The Xbox One offers the ability for users to record and share "clips" from gameplay or live-stream directly to Twitch, Ustream, and other streaming platforms. The console's controller was redesigned over the Xbox 360's, with a redesigned body, D-pad and triggers capable of delivering directional haptic feedback.Prior to its official release, the Xbox One received mixed reviews; the entertainment-oriented features were praised, but controversy surrounded several policy changes since the Xbox 360's release, including a proposed always-on digital rights management (DRM) system, and concerns over a mandate that the Kinect sensor be used at all times. Microsoft retracted these changes prior to the launch, and it received mostly positive reception for its refined controller design, multimedia features, and voice navigation. Xbox One's original user interface was panned for being nonintuitive, although changes made to it and other aspects of the console's software post-launch received positive reception.A redesigned model known as Xbox One S was released in August 2016; it has a streamlined design, and minor hardware upgrades which add support for 4K video playback and upscaling, and HDR10 high-dynamic-range color. A future hardware revision codenamed "Project Scorpio" is scheduled for late-2017; it will feature major hardware upgrades focused on enabling 4K gameplay and support for virtual reality hardware, and will be backwards compatible with all existing Xbox One software and hardware.

VThe Northrop SM-62 Snark was an early-model intercontinental range ground-launched cruise missile that could carry a W39 thermonuclear warhead. The Snark was deployed by the United States Air Force's Strategic Air Command from 1958 through 1961. It represented an important step in weapons technology during the Cold War. The Snark took its name from the author Lewis Carroll's character the "snark".The Snark missile was developed to present a nuclear deterrent to the Soviet Union and other potential enemies at a time when Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) were still in development. The Snark was the only surface-to-surface cruise missile with such a long range that was ever deployed by the U.S. Air Force. Following the deployment of ICBMs, the Snark was rendered obsolete, and it was removed from deployment in 1961.

VThe Ubuntu Edge was a proposed high-concept smartphone announced by Canonical Ltd. on 22 July 2013. Canonical was seeking to crowdfund a production run of around 40,000 units through Indiegogo. It had the highest target of any crowdfunded project to date, $32,000,000 over a one-month campaign. The Edge was not intended to go into mass production after the initial run, but rather to serve as a demonstration for new technologies for the industry. The Edge fell short of its funding goal, raising only $12,809,906, with 5682 pledges to purchase the standard model of the handset.The Edge was designed as a hybrid device, which would function as a high-end smartphone (with both Ubuntu Touch and Android), or\u2014when used with a monitor, keyboard and mouse\u2014be able to operate as a conventional desktop PC running Ubuntu. The Ubuntu Edge was also designed to support dual boot, and was to run along with Android.

VThe Game Boy Camera, released as Pocket Camera (\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30ab\u30e1\u30e9) in Japan, is an official Nintendo accessory for the handheld Game Boy gaming console and was released on September 17, 1998 in Japan, which ceased manufacture in late 2002. It is compatible with all of the Game Boy platforms (with the exception of Game Boy Micro). The camera can take 256×224 (down scaled to half resolution on the unit with anti-aliasing), black & white digital images using the 4-color palette of the Game Boy system. It interfaced with the Game Boy Printer, which utilized thermal paper to print any saved images, making a hardcopy. Both the camera and the printer were marketed by Nintendo as light-hearted entertainment devices aimed mainly at children in all three major video game regions of the world: Japan, North America, and Europe. N64 Magazine (which has since been superseded by NGamer) dedicated a monthly section to the device.The Game Boy Camera comes in five different standard colors: blue, green, red, yellow and clear purple (Japan only). There was also a limited edition gold The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time edition, which contains different stamps from the standard versions and was available only in the United States through a mail order offer from Nintendo Power.The device's software has numerous references to other Nintendo products. Also, there are a few differences between the North American and Japanese versions, including the unlockable B album pictures and the stamps that can be placed on pictures.The Game Boy Camera was featured in the 1999 edition of Guinness World Records for being the world's smallest digital camera, though this record has since been broken. Nintendo reportedly had plans to release a successor to the Game Boy Camera for the Game Boy Advance called the GameEye which would take color photos and feature connectivity with the Nintendo GameCube through a game titled Stage Debut, but neither the GameEye nor Stage Debut ever saw release.

VThe Epson QX-10 is a microcomputer running CP/M or TPM-III (CP/M-80 compatible) which was introduced in 1983. It was based on a Zilog Z80 microprocessor, running at 4 MHz, provided up to 256 KB of RAM organized in four switchable banks, and included a separate graphics processor chip (µPD7220) manufactured by NEC to provide advanced graphics capabilities. In the USA, two versions were launched; a basic CP/M configuration with 64 KB RAM and the HASCI configuration with 256 KB RAM and the special HASCI keyboard to be used with the bundled application suite, called Valdocs. The European and Japanese versions were like the CP/M configurations. TPM-III was used for Valdocs and some copy protected programs like Logo Professor.The machine had internal extension slots, which could be used for extra serial ports, network cards or third party extensions like an Intel 8088 processor, adding MS-DOS compatibility.Rising Star Industries was the primary American software vendor for the HASCI QX series. Their product line included the TPM-II and III operating system, Valdocs, a robust Basic language implementation, a graphics API library used by a variety of products which initially supported line drawing and fill functions and was later extended to support the QX-16 color boards, Z80 assembler, and low level Zapple machine code monitor which could be invoked from dip switch setting on the rear of the machine.

VThe MBC-550 was a small and inexpensive personal computer in "pizza-box" style, featuring an Intel 8088 microprocessor and running a version of MS-DOS. It was the lowest-cost of the early IBM PC compatibles and was produced by Sanyo.It had somewhat better video display possibilities than the average CGA card (8 colors at 640x200 resolution, vs CGA's 4 colors at 320x200 or 2 colors at 640x200), but it was not completely compatible with the IBM-PC. It lacked a standard BIOS, having only a minimal bootloader in ROM that accessed hardware directly to load a RAM-based BIOS. The (FM rather than MFM) diskette format used was not completely compatible with the IBM PC, but special software on an original PC or PC/XT (but not PC/AT) could read and write the diskettes, and software expecting a standard 18.2 Hz clock interrupt had to be rewritten.The MBC-550 was also the computer of choice for NRI training. Starting by building the computer, the NRI promised you would be "qualified to service and repair virtually every major brand of computer". They advertised in Popular Mechanics and Popular Science throughout 1985.By August 1985 InfoWorld reported that Sanyo "has initiated a campaign to sell off" its MBC-550 inventory. The company's newer computers were, an executive claimed, 99% PC compatible.

VThe hanb\u014d (\u534a\u68d2, lit. "half-staff") is a staff used in martial arts. Traditionally, the hanb\u014d was approximately three shaku or about 90 centimetres (35 in) long, half the length of the usual staff, the rokushakub\u014d ("six shaku staff"). Diameter was 2.4 to 3 centimetres (0.94 to 1.18 in). However, depending on the school the length and diameter varied.As with any weapon, bearers would often find one best suited to their build, opting often for one that comes up to about waist/hip height.

VThe Henschel Hs 117 Schmetterling (German for Butterfly) was a radio-guided German surface-to-air missile project developed during World War II. There was also an air-to-air version, the Hs 117H.The operators used a telescopic sight and a joystick to guide the missile by radio control, which was detonated by acoustic and photoelectric proximity fuses, at 10\u201320 m (33\u201366 ft).

VThe Opel Cam-In-Head engine ("CIH" for short) is a series of inline engines which was built from 1965 until 1995 and was available in four- or six-cylinder configurations. Its name derives from the location of the camshaft, which was a compromise between an overhead valve and an overhead cam layout. The camshaft was mounted above the cylinder but aside the valves and actuated them through a very short tappet and a rocker arm, as it was not near enough to act directly upon the valves. The layout was an evolutionary dead-end and was not adapted for other engines. The 4-cylinder CIH was largely supplanted by the Family II unit as Opel/Vauxhall's core mid-size engine in the 1980s, with a large capacity 2.4L version of the CIH remaining in limited production until 1998 in the Omega A and latterly, the Frontera A models. The 6-cylinder versions of the CIH remained in volume production until 1995.There was also a diesel engine using this layout, first seen in the Opel Rekord D in 1972.

VThe 2.2 and 2.5 are a family of inline-4 engines developed by Chrysler Corporation originally for the Chrysler K- and L-platforms cars and subsequently used in many other Chrysler vehicles. After its launch in 1981, it became the basis for all Chrysler-developed 4-cylinder engines until the Chrysler 1.8, 2.0 & 2.4 engine family was released in 1994.

VThe PT-76 is a Soviet amphibious light tank that was introduced in the early 1950s and soon became the standard reconnaissance tank of the Soviet Army and the other Warsaw Pact armed forces. It was widely exported to other friendly states, like India, Iraq, Syria, North Korea and North Vietnam. Overall, some 25 countries used the PT-76.The tank's full name is Swimming Tank\u201376 (\u041f\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u0422\u0430\u043d\u043a, Plavayushchiy Tank, or \u041f\u0422-76). 76 stands for the caliber of the main armament: the 76.2 mm D-56T series rifled tank gun.The PT-76 is used in the reconnaissance and fire-support roles. Its chassis served as the basis for a number of other vehicle designs, many of them amphibious, including the BTR-50 armored personnel carrier, the ZSU-23-4 self-propelled antiaircraft gun, the ASU-85 airborne self-propelled gun and the 2K12 Kub anti-aircraft missile launch vehicle.

VThe OnePlus One (colloquially abbreviated to OPO) is an Android smartphone manufactured by OnePlus, a Chinese startup company co-founded by former Oppo vice president Pete Lau. Unveiled in April 2014, it is the first product by OnePlus. The One was designed to compare favorably \u2013 in performance, quality, and price \u2013 to flagship devices by leading smartphone manufacturers. The One ships to most markets with the Cyanogen OS operating system pre-installed. Cyanogen OS is a commercial variant of CyanogenMod.The phone was first made available for sale on 25 April 2014, exclusively from the OnePlus website, but initially required prospective customers to obtain an invitation before they could purchase it. These invitations were primarily distributed by the company through contests, some of which attracted attention for their unconventional or controversial nature. On 6 June 2014, the device was available for general sale.As of 20 April 2015, the device no longer requires an invite to purchase.

Cyanogen OS is a commercial variant of CyanogenMod.The phone was first made available for sale on 25 April 2014, exclusively from the OnePlus website, but initially required prospective customers to obtain an invitation before they could purchase it. These invitations were primarily distributed by the company through contests, some of which attracted attention for their unconventional or controversial nature. On 6 June 2014, the device was available for general sale.As of 20 April 2015, the device no longer requires an invite to purchase.

VThe AQM-127 Supersonic Low-Altitude Target (SLAT) was a target drone developed during the 1980s by Martin Marietta for use by the United States Navy. Derived from Martin Marietta's work on the cancelled ASALM missile, SLAT proved to have severe difficulties in flight testing, and the project was cancelled during 1991.

VThe Macintosh TV is Apple Computer's first attempt at computer-television integration. It shared the external appearance of the Macintosh LC 500 series, but in black. The Macintosh TV was essentially a Performa 520 that could switch its built-in 14" Sony Trinitron CRT from being a computer display to a cable-ready television. It was incapable of showing television in a desktop window, although it could capture still frames to PICT files.It came with a small credit card-sized remote control that was also compatible with Sony televisions. It was the first Macintosh to be made in black and came with a custom black keyboard and mouse. Later Apple would issue a custom black Performa 5420 in markets outside the United States with many of the features of the Mac TV. Apple's similar TV tuner card was a popular option for later LC and Performa series computers.Only 10,000 were made in the model's short time on the market.

VThe GM small-block engine family is an engine design intended as the primary V-8 engine used in General Motors' line of rear-wheel-drive cars and trucks. The GM small-block series was a "clean sheet" design with only the rod bearings and bore spacing in common in terms of shared parts and dimensions with the classic Chevrolet small block V8. The basic layout owes a good deal to the essential concept of Ed Cole's original small-block design of 1954-55, though the small-block engine also uses design cues from Buick, Oldsmobile, and Pontiac engines. Some small-block engines are all-aluminium, especially the performance oriented engines, while others use cast iron blocks. The aluminum block engines use cast iron cylinder liners.The small-block engine has been the main powerplant of the Chevrolet Corvette since 1956, and has seen use in a wide variety of other General Motors vehicles, ranging from sport coupes to full size trucks. Due to the engine's relatively compact external dimensions compared to its displacement and power output, the engine family is also a popular choice for engine swaps, import cars, kit cars, hot rods, boats, buggies, and even light aircraft.

The aluminum block engines use cast iron cylinder liners.Several versions of the GM small-block LS engine were used in the Chevrolet Corvette beginning with the LS1 in 1997 through the LS9 and others in 2013. Variants of the LT version of the GM small-block have been used since.

VThe Shooting Star Tommy Gun is a pneumatic machine gun manufactured by Shooting Star Inc. It was invented by Charles A. Feltman, the son of Charles Feltman, often credited as the inventor of the hot dog in Coney Island, New York with young Feltman previously inventing a hot dog roll toaster.The first version of the game was called "Mow 'Em Down" and featured a pneumatic machine gun resembling a water cooled heavy machine gun and was invented in 1939. Later Feltman modified the design to resemble a Thompson submachine gun with a patent granted in 1941 The weapon fired 100 .177 BBs.Feltman industries operated in Coney Island for many years until it then moved to New Jersey and became Shooting Star Inc, as the object of the game was to shoot out all traces of a red star on a white paper card.

VPansarsprängvinggranat m/94 STRIX is a Swedish endphase-guided projectile fired from a 120 mm mortar currently manufactured by Saab Bofors Dynamics.STRIX is fired like a conventional mortar round. The round contains an infrared imaging sensor that it uses to guide itself onto any tank or armoured fighting vehicle in the vicinity where it lands. The seeker is designed to ignore targets that are already burning.Launched from any 120 mm mortar, Strix has a normal range of up to 4.5 km. With the addition of a special sustainer motor, however, range can be increased to 7.5 km.The Strix mortar round uses twelve midsection lateral thruster rockets to provide terminal course corrections.The tail unit is loaded first with the necessary propelling charges (up to eight increments), then the sustainer motor (if required) and finally, the programmed projectile. A hand-held programming unit is connected to the projectile by cable prior to loading to feed in flight time before seeker activation, and with allowances for terminal phase ballistic conditions.As well as being fired by conventional mortars, STRIX can be fired by the Advanced Mortar System, an automatic dual 120 mm mortar mounted in a turret for fitting to armoured fighting vehicles.Feasibility and project definition studies began in 1983, as a joint private venture between FFV Ordnance and Saab Missiles. The first fully guided flight took place in 1988. FFV expected to complete development this year, and to receive a Swedish Army production contract shortly thereafter. The company reports considerable foreign interest, in particular from the US Marine Corps. STRIX has been in service with the Swedish and Swiss Armies since 1994.

VThe Duramax is a General Motors diesel engine family for light to medium duty trucks, designed by GM and Isuzu. The 6.6-liter Duramax is produced by DMAX, a joint venture between GM and Isuzu in Moraine, Ohio. The Duramax block and heads are poured at The Defiance GM Powertrain foundry in Defiance, Ohio. This engine was initially installed in 2001 model year Chevy and GMC trucks and has been an option since then in pickups, vans, and medium-duty trucks. In 2006, production at Moraine was reportedly limited to approximately 200,000 engines per year. On May 9, 2007, DMAX announced the production of the 1,000,000th Duramax V-8 diesel at its Moraine facility.

VThe B-series are a family of inline four-cylinder DOHC automotive engines introduced by Honda in 1989. Sold concurrently with the D-series which were primarily SOHC engines designed for more economical applications, the B-series were aimed more as a performance option featuring dual-overhead cams along with the first application of Honda's VTEC system (available in some models). To identify a Honda B-series engine, the letter B is normally followed by two numbers to designate the displacement of the engine, another letter, and in US-spec engines, another number. The Japanese spec-engines are normally designated with a four character alphanumeric designation. The B-series, the B20B variant in particular, is not to be confused with the earlier Honda B20A engine introduced in 1985 and primarily available in the Prelude and Accord-derived vehicles from 1985-1991. While sharing some design elements and both being multivalve Honda four-cylinders, the B-series and B20A differ substantially in architecture, enough to be considered distinct engine families.They were made in 1.6-, 1.7-, 1.8-, and 2.0-liter variants, with and without VTEC (Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control). Later models have minor upgrades including modifications to the intake valves and ports and piston tops, along with individual cylinder oil injectors (B18C models). They produce between 130 hp (97 kW) and 200 hp (149 kW), with some models capable of a redline over 8,500 rpm.Although it has so many variations, the basic design differs very little among the B-Series. There are actually two short blocks which are used for the entire series. The main difference between them was the deck height. The one used for B16 and B17 engines (except for B16B) has a deck height of 203.9mm while the short block used for B16B, B18 and B20 engines has a deck height of 212mm.The Honda B16 has appeared in six different forms over the years.The Honda B-series was replaced by the K-series in Civic, Integra, and CR-V applications.

VThe Honda K series engine is a four-cylinder four-stroke engine introduced in 2001. The K series engines are equipped with DOHC valvetrains and use roller rockers to reduce friction. The engines use a coil-on-plug, distributorless ignition system with a coil for each spark plug. This system forgoes the use of a conventional distributor-based ignition timing system in favor of a computer-controlled system that allows the ECU to control ignition timings based on various sensor inputs. The cylinders have cast iron sleeves similar to the B-series & F-series engines, as opposed to the FRM cylinders found in the H-series and newer F series engines found only in the Honda S2000.Similar to B series, K-Series has two short blocks with the same design; the only difference between them being the deck height. K20 uses the short block with a deck height of 212mm where K23 and K24 block has a deck height of 231.5mm.Two versions of the Honda i-VTEC system can be found on a K series engine, and both versions can come with variable timing control (VTC) on the intake cam. The VTEC system on engines like the K20A3 only operate on the intake cam; at low rpm only one intake valve is fully opened, the other opening just slightly to create a swirl effect in the combustion chamber for improved fuel atomization. At high rpm, both intake valves open fully to improve engine breathing. In engines such as the K20A2 found in the Acura RSX Type-S, the VTEC system operates on both the intake and exhaust valves, allowing both to benefit from multiple cam profiles.

VThe TurboExpress is a handheld video game console, released by NEC Home Electronics in 1990. It is essentially a portable version of the TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine home console that came two to three years earlier. It was sold as the PC Engine GT (Game Tank) in Japan.Unlike the original Game Boy, it can play all the TurboGrafx-16's HuCard games. It has a 66 mm (2.6 in.) screen, the same size as the original Game Boy, and can display 64 sprites at once, 16 per scanline, in up to 481 colors from a palette of 512. It has 8 kilobytes of RAM. The Turbo runs its HuC6280 CPU at 1.79 or 7.16 MHz.As part of the fourth generation of gaming, the TurboExpress primarily competed with Nintendo's Game Boy, Sega's Game Gear, and the Atari Lynx. However, with 1.5 million units sold, far behind its two main competitors, NEC failed to gain significant sales or market share in the handheld market.Its launch price in the U.S. was $249.99. The price was briefly raised to $299.99, soon dropped back to $249.99, and by 1992 it was $199.99.

VThe PC Engine GT (Japanese: PC\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30f3GT) is a handheld video game console by NEC Home Electronics, released in Japan in late 1990 and later in the United States as the TurboExpress. It is essentially a portable version of the TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine home console that came two to three years earlier. Its launch price in Japan was ¥44,800, whereas in the U.S. was $249.99, briefly raising to $299.99, soon dropping back to $249.99, and $199.99 by 1992.The TurboExpress was technically advanced at the time, able to play all the TurboGrafx-16's HuCard games, and also featuring a TV tuner. It has a 66 mm (2.6 in.) screen, the same size as the original Game Boy, and can display 64 sprites at once, 16 per scanline, in up to 481 colors from a palette of 512. It has 8 kilobytes of RAM.

VThe BMW N52 is a straight-6 DOHC piston engine which was produced from 2004-2015. It debuted on the E90 330i and E63 630i. In European markets, it began to be phased out following the release of the N53 in 2007. However, in markets such as North America, Australia or Malaysia, the N53 was deemed unsuitable due to the high levels of sulfur in the fuel. Therefore, the N52 remained in production until its replacement by the N20 turbocharged 4-cylinder engine in 2015.Compared with its M54 predecessor, the N52 features variable valve lift (called Valvetronic by BMW), a lighter block due to the use of a magnesium alloy and an electric water pump and a variable oil pump. Like the M54, the N52 uses an electronic throttle control, variable valve timing to both camshafts (called dual VANOS by BMW) and a dual length intake manifold (called "DISA" by BMW).

VThe Ford SHO V6 is a family of DOHC V6 engines fitted to the Ford Taurus SHO from 1989 to 1995. The designation SHO denotes Super High Output.Due to the engine's unusual and aesthetically pleasing appearance it is sometimes transplanted into other vehicles. Its distinctive variable length intake manifold is bilaterally symmetrical, so it can be rotated 180 degrees (making it face "backwards" on the engine, relative to its original installation orientation) to ease the engine's transition from transverse to longitudinal mounting.The SHO engines share a common bell housing pattern with the following Ford engines: the 2.3/2.5 L FWD HSC I4, the 3.0 L FWD/RWD Vulcan V6, and the 3.8 L FWD Canadian Essex V6. In 1996, Ford discontinued the SHO V6 and began fitting the Taurus SHO's with the SHO 3.4 L V8 and the Ford AX4N automatic transmission.

VThe Mazda K-series automobile engine is a short stroke 60° 24-valve V6 with belt-driven DOHC and all-alloy construction. Displacements range from 1.8 L to 2.5 L. They all use a 27-degree DOHC valvetrain with directly actuated hydraulic bucket lifters. The K-series also feature a highly rigid aluminum split-crankcase engine block design with 4-bolt mains with additional bolts securing the lower block, an internally balanced forged steel crankshaft with lightweight powder forged carbon steel connecting rods. They were designed with the intent of being as compact as possible for short-hood front-wheel drive applications.One unique innovation of the K-series was the introduction of Variable Resonance Induction System (VRIS). Based on the Helmholtz resonance principle, the intake manifold is equipped with 3 chambers tuned to a specific resonant frequency. The computer dynamically switches between each resonant chamber to achieve the appropriate resonant frequency for the engine's rpm. This effect optimizes volumetric efficiency over a given rpm range to provide maximum torque over the entire rpm range. VRIS is used on the K8, KF, and KL but nearly all modern V6s are now using this technology.The K-series all have a 7,000 rpm redline with 7500-7800 rpm limiter, which given the engine design is conservative. The KJ-ZEM Miller cycle engine had a 6,000 rpm redline, but was only available with an automatic transmission.

VThe Mazda Wankel engines (a type of rotary combustion engine) comprise a family of car engines derived from experiments in the early 1960s by Felix Wankel, a German engineer. Over the years, displacement has been increased and turbocharging has been added.Wankel engines can be classified by their geometric size in terms of radius (rotor center to tip distance, also the median stator radius) and depth (rotor thickness), and offset (crank throw, eccentricity, also 1/4 the difference between stator's major and minor axes). These metrics function similarly to the bore and stroke measurements of a piston engine. Displacement is 3\u221a3radius·offset·depth, multiplied with the number of rotors (note that this only counts a single face of each rotor as the entire rotor's displacement). Nearly all Mazda production Wankel engines share a single rotor radius, 105 mm (4.1 in), with a 15 mm (0.6 in) crankshaft offset. The only engine to diverge from this formula was the rare 13A, which used a 120 mm (4.7 in) rotor radius and 17.5 mm (0.7 in) crankshaft offset.Mazda rotary engines have a reputation for being relatively small and powerful at the expense of poor fuel efficiency. The engines became popular with kit car builders, hot rodders and in light aircraft because of their light weight, compact size, tuning potential stemming and inherently high power-to-weight ratio - as is true to all Wankel-type engine. Mazda put the engine into serial production, with NSU (Ro80) and Citroën (GS Birotor), as part of the Comotor joint-venture, between 1967 and 1977.Since the end of production of the Mazda RX-8 in 2012, the engine is produced only for single seater racing, with the one-make Star Mazda Championship being contested with a Wankel engine.

VThe VE engine is a 3.0 L V6 piston engine from Nissan. It is based on the Nissan VG engine and was only used for the 1992, 1993, and 1994 model years. This engine has an iron block, aluminum cylinder heads with 4 valves per cylinder and dual overhead camshafts, variable valve timing on the intake camshafts, coil-on-plug ignition, and an available variable intake manifold (5-speed only).A major difference between the VE30DE and the VG30DE engine is the heads. The low under-hood clearance on the 1992\u20131994 Nissan Maxima demanded a special head to be developed with 30°, rather than 46°, between the valves. Lack of space also demanded a redesigned camshaft drive system, so a special chain drive was developed. The engine is otherwise similar to the VG30DE.

VThe H family is a line of 60° V6 automobile engines from Suzuki. Ranging in displacement from 2.0 L to 2.7 L, the H family was a modern all-aluminum engine with dual overhead cams, 24 valves, and multi-port fuel injection. It was co-developed with Mazda, which used a similar design in their 2.0 L KF V6. The H family was introduced in 1994 with the H20, but Suzuki and Mazda's designs diverged greatly with the former increasing displacement and the latter experimenting with alternative induction technologies and smaller engine sizes.

VVolvo designed the SI6 ("short inline 6") straight-6 automobile engine for use in 2007 models. An evolution of the company's long-used straight-5, which itself is an evolution of the Volvo B6304 straight six engine, the SI6 can be mounted transversely for front wheel drive or all wheel drive applications. Despite the added cylinder and displacement, the engine remains compact, and is in fact 1 mm (0.04 in) shorter than the previous straight-5. The engine will be offered in two displacements initially \u2014 a 3.0 L turbocharged version and a 3.2 L naturally aspirated version. Both offer variable cam timing, though only the turbo version varies both the intake and exhaust valves. On top of the variable cam timing used on the intake cam of the naturally aspirated engine it also has variable valve lift by using Cam Profile Switching (CPS).Production of the Volvo SI6 began at the Ford Bridgend Engine Plant in Wales in May 2006. It was assumed that the engines would be used in European Ford and Jaguar products as well as Volvos.

VThe AN-11 was France's first nuclear weapon, developed to arm the Force de frappe.The AN-11's development began in the late 1950s. An early version was used in France's first nuclear test, Gerboise Bleue, on 13 February 1960. The first AN-11 prototype was tested 1 May 1962, and it entered service in 1964.The AN-11 was a pure fission weapon, a plutonium implosion type. It weighed approximately 1,500 kg (3,306 lb). It was a free-fall bomb intended to be dropped from high-altitude bombers. The explosive Nuclear weapon yield was about 60 kt.About 40 AN-11s were produced between 1963 and 1968. The carrier was the Dassault Mirage IV, although some reports suggest the Sud Aviation Vautour could also carry this bomb. Beginning in 1967 it was replaced by the more advanced AN-22 bomb.

VThe AN-22 was France's second air-dropped nuclear weapon, developed as a replacement for the earlier AN-11 bomb, entering service in 1967. It had a similar 60 to 70 kilotons yield fission warhead to the earlier AN-11, but with enhanced safety features and a parachute retarder to enable it to be dropped at low level. Additionally the casing was redesigned reducing its weight from approximately 1,400 kg (3,000 lb) to around 700 kg (1,500 lb). It was carried by the Dassault Mirage IV.A stockpile of about 40 weapons was maintained, providing one for each of the 36 Mirage IVAs in service, plus several spares. The last warhead was retired on 1 July 1988, at which point the ASMP stand-off weapon took over the role previously held by the AN-22.

It had three models and its color monitor, PC-KD651, which could be used vertically or horizontally, had the price tag of 198,000 yen. Its biggest advantage over other computers of that time was its high graphical capability of 720 by 512 with a selection of 16 color out of 512 color available on its high end model30. Its OS was MS-DOS and was also equipped with a spreadsheet program Maruchipuran (Multiplan) and a text editor JS-WORD as well as the game Lode Runner.Far ahead of its time and too costly, PC-100 did not sell well. A complete set with the printer PC-PR201 that could print alphabet, hiragana, katakana and kanji, came to nearly a million yen. For a comparison, the Nintendo Family Computer released in July of the same year was only 14,800 yen and the vaunted Apple Lisa 2 sold for 2.2 million yen.

VA pneumatic weapon is a weapon that fires a projectile by means of air pressure, similar in principle to the operation of pneumatic tube delivery systems. The term comes from a Greek word for "wind" or "breath" (\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1).

VThe SRAM II (Short-Range Attack Missile) was a nuclear air-to-surface missile intended as a replacement for the AGM-69 SRAM, but it was cancelled by President George H.W. Bush for geopolitical reasons just as the first flight-test missile was delivered.The mission of the SRAM family is to deliver the warhead to the target without the need for the penetrating bomber to directly overfly the target. The SRAM family of weapons had an extremely small radar signature and were near-impossible to counter. SRAM ensured the airborne leg of the US nuclear triad (the others being land-based ICBMs and SLBM) and was the penetrating airlaunched strategic nuclear weapon for the B-1 Lancer and B-2 Spirit.In 1977, the USAF planned to develop an upgrade of the SRAM for the forthcoming B-1A bomber as AGM-69B SRAM B. When the B-1A was cancelled in 1978, the AGM-69B was dropped, too. After the resurrection of the B-1 program (as B-1B) in 1981, it was decided to develop an entirely new weapon, the SRAM II.In 1986, Boeing was finally awarded a development contract for the AGM-131A SRAM II. The AGM-131A was planned to have only about 2/3 the size of an AGM-69A, so that 36 missiles could be carried by the B-1B, as compared to 24 AGM-69As. The final design of the SRAM II ended up with the "II" version roughly equal to the "A" version in size and about 80% of the weight. One new feature of SRAM II was a lighter, simpler, and more reliable two-pulse solid rocket motor designed by Hercules for increased range and age stability.The SRAM II was slated to use the newly developed W89 thermonuclear warhead, which being much newer, was also much safer to operate than the W-69 of the AGM-69. The W89 had a 200 kiloton design yield,Initial Operational Capability for the AGM-131A was planned for 1993, but before flight tests could take place, the program was cancelled in 1991.

VNuclear latency is the condition of a country possessing the technology to quickly build nuclear weapons, without having actually yet done so. Because such latent capability is not proscribed by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, this is sometimes called the "Japan Option" (as a work-around to the treaty), as Japan is a clear case of a country with complete technical prowess to develop a nuclear weapon quickly, or as it is sometimes called "being one screwdriver's turn" from the bomb, as Japan is considered to have the materials, expertise and technical capacity to make a nuclear bomb at will.

VFerrari's earliest cars used engines designed by Gioacchino Colombo, who had formerly designed Alfa Romeos for Enzo Ferrari. These V12 powerplants ranged from the diminutive 1.5 L (1497 cc) unit fitted to the 125S to the 4.9 L (4943 cc) unit in the 1986 412i. Significant updates were made in 1963 for the 330 series featuring a redesigned block with wider bore spacing.Enzo Ferrari had long admired the V12 engines of Packard, Auto Union, and Alfa Romeo(where he was long employed), but his first car, the 1940 Auto Avio Costruzioni 815, used a Fiat straight-8. It was only natural that his first homegrown engine would be a V12, and the same basic design would last many years, with development continuing long after original designer Colombo had been replaced by Aurelio Lampredi as the company's marquee engine designer. Although Lampredi's engines were a real force for the company, it was Colombo's V12 which would be the primary motivator for the company's consumer products through the 1950s and 1960s.

VAurelio Lampredi designed a number of racing engines for Ferrari. He was brought on to hedge the company's bets with a different engine family than the small V12s designed by Gioacchino Colombo. Lampredi went on to design a number of different Inline-4, Inline-6, and V12 engines through the 1950s, and it was these that would power the company's string of world championships that decade. All were quickly abandoned, however, with the Dino V6 and V8 taking the place of the fours and sixes and evolution of the older Colombo V12 continuing as the company's preeminent V12.
