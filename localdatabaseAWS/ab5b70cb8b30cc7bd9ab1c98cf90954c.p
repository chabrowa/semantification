VLinwood Bookard "Lin" Sexton (born April 16, 1926) is a former American football halfback who played for the Los Angeles Dons. He played college football at Wichita State University, having previously attended East High School in Wichita. He was one of the first African-American college football players to play for Wichita State, and in the Missouri Valley Conference, and thus was barred from participating in certain games and was forced to make separate travel arrangements due to the segregation policies in place at the time. He was named to the All-Conference team in 1945, 1946, and 1947, the first African-American player to have accomplished the feat. The Linwood Sexton Endowed Scholarship from his alma mater, Wichita State, is named in his honor. In 2011, he was inducted into the Missouri Valley Conference Athletics Hall of Fame. He is also a member of the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame (inducted 2001).

VWilliam Lewis "Billy" Shaw (born December 15, 1938) is an American former college and professional football player.Drafted in 1961 by the American Football League's Buffalo Bills, Billy Shaw of Georgia Tech was the prototypical "pulling guard" who despite his size held his own against much bigger defensive linemen like Ernie Ladd, Earl Faison and Buck Buchanan. With the Bills, he won three straight Eastern Division titles and two American Football League championships in 1964 and 1965.Shaw was a first-team All-American Football League selection four times (1963 through 1966) and second team All-AFL in 1968 and 1969. He played in eight American Football League All-Star Games and was named to the All-Time All-AFL Team. He made the All-Decade All-pro football team of the 1960s. Shaw played his entire career in the American Football League, and retired after the 1969 AFL season.Shaw is the only player ever inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame without ever playing in the NFL (The Bills along with the rest of the AFL merged with the NFL the season following his retirement). He is also a member of the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame and the Bills' 50th Anniversary Team.

He played professionally as a safety in the American Football League (AFL) for the Denver Broncos and in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Francisco 49ers. Gonsoulin played college football at Baylor University.At the end of his stint with the Broncos, he was the AFL's all-time leader in interceptions with 40. He made the first interception ever in the AFL, in the first league game against the Boston Patriots. He had seven interceptions in his first three games, and his 11 pickoffs in 1960 are still a Denver club record. He shares the team record for interceptions in a game with four, a feat he accomplished September 18, 1960 at Buffalo.Gonsoulin was a Sporting News AFL All-League player in 1960, 1962, and 1963, and an AFL Western Division All-Star in 1961, 1964 and 1966. His amazing durability and toughness enabled him to start 61 consecutive games at one point in his career. He was also the captain of his college team at Baylor. Gonsoulin was selected to the second unit of the American Football League All-Time Team.Gonsoulin died on September 8, 2014.

VThomas Joseph Sestak (March 9, 1936 \u2013 April 3, 1987) was an American football defensive lineman who played for the Buffalo Bills of the American Football League (AFL).In 1962, following an innovative AFL trend of drafting players from small colleges, the Bills drafted Sestak as a tight end in the 17th round from McNeese State University. Sestak would never play that position for the Bills, but instead became one of the league's greatest defensive tackles. At 6-4, he had the size, speed and strength to handle any offensive lineman.Sestak was a starter in his rookie year and, until a series of knee injuries ended his career after the 1967 season, used his strength to dominate the line of scrimmage. Sestak was a three-time selection to All-American Football League teams and a unanimous All-AFL defensive tackle in three consecutive years; 1963, 1964 and 1965. Sestak served as the cornerstone of a defense that took the Bills to the playoffs four straight years (1963\u20131966) and consecutive AFL championships in 1964 and 1965. Over the 1964 and 1965 seasons, Sestak and his defense mates held opposing rushers without a touchdown for seventeen consecutive games, a Professional Football record that still stands. Twice during his outstanding career he realized the defensive lineman's "dream", returning interceptions for touchdowns, and once returned a recovered fumble for a score.His teammates described his play as "crazy as hell".During the 1960s, only six professional defensive linemen were unanimous All-League selections for three or more years, Sestak (3), Bob Lily (5), Merlin Olsen (4), Willie Davis (3), Gino Marchetti (3), and Deacon Jones (3). The latter five, all former NFL players, have already been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, while Sestak, a star from the AFL, like many other AFL players has been ignored by the Hall of Fame selectors.In January 1970, Sestak was selected as a member of the All-Time All-AFL Team, and in 2009 as a member of the Bills' 50th Anniversary Team. In 2007, Tom Sestak was inducted into the National Polish American Sports Hall of Fame.Sestak died of a heart attack in 1987.

He is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, class of 1997. Nicknamed "Iron Mike", Webster anchored the Steelers' offensive line during much of their run of four Super Bowl victories from 1974 to 1979 and is considered by some as the best center in NFL history.Webster was the first former NFL player diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Since his death, he has become a symbol for head injuries in the NFL and the ongoing debate over player safety. His doctors were of the opinion that multiple concussions during his career damaged his frontal lobe, which caused cognitive dysfunction.Webster died at the age of 50. His cause of death was first announced to be a heart attack by the Steelers' management, but this was later recanted. Webster's cause of death has not been released from the hospital at his family's request.

VMark George Miller (born August 13, 1956 in Canton, Ohio) is a former American football quarterback. He played with the Cleveland Browns (1978\u20131979) before being traded in August 1980 to the Green Bay Packers, where he saw no action. Miller then briefly resurfaced with the Michigan Panthers of the United States Football League in 1983.Miller had put together a solid college career with Bowling Green State University (1974\u20131977), resulting in the Browns making him a third round selection in the 1978 NFL Draft. During his brief career his role was that of a backup quarterback, consequently making his playing time limited. He attempted 47 passes, completed 15 for only 243 yards, seeing the most action in the 1978 regular season finale against the Cincinnati Bengals after replacing an injured Brian Sipe.

A photographer from a local newspaper noticed the scene and snapped a photo of the two. The image became the inspiration for the official logo of the East-West Shrine Game and is displayed annually on the 50-yard line.

VAlan Ricard (born January 17, 1977) is a former American football fullback. Before signing with the Browns he played with the Baltimore Ravens from 2001 to 2005, and briefly for the Buffalo Bills in 2006. He played college football at the University of Louisiana at Monroe.Ricard originally entered the league with the Dallas Cowboys as an undrafted free agent in 1999 but was released. He signed with Baltimore in 2000 and spent a year on the practice squad before earning a spot on the active roster in 2001. In 55 appearances with the Ravens, including 32 starts, Ricard carried just 43 times for 172 yards and two touchdowns and posted 32 receptions for 179 yards. But he was a dominant blocker at times in the running game and was solid in pass protection. Ricard was a key contributor in helping Jamal Lewis achieve his 2,066 yard rushing season in 2003, and he made the Pro Bowl as an alternate.

VBilly Joe Hobert (born January 8, 1971) is a former professional American football quarterback. While at the University of Washington, he led the Huskies to a national championship in 1991, during his redshirt sophomore season. He was elevated to the starting position after junior Mark Brunell suffered a serious knee injury during spring drills, causing him to miss much of the 1991 season.After the success of the 1991 season, Hobert became implicated in a major NCAA scandal when it was revealed he had received a series of loans totaling $50,000 made by the father-in-law of a friend while Hobert himself had no assets and no specific payment schedule. This would cost Hobert his college eligibility, and was an aggravating factor in the University receiving PAC-10 sanctions for lack of institutional control, in turn leading to head coach Don James resigning in protest. Although several other Huskies players were implicated in improprieties, Hobert became the most well-known face of the sanctions, leading to him receiving death threats.1991 Season: 173/285 for 2,271 yards with 22 TDs, 10 INTs, 56 yards rushing and 5 TDs.Hobert was the 58th pick in the 1993 NFL Draft, selected by the Los Angeles Raiders, 60 picks ahead of teammate Mark Brunell. Hobert was the third quarterback selected in the draft, behind the top two overall picks, Drew Bledsoe and Rick Mirer. Hobert was also drafted in the 16th round (453rd overall) of the 1993 Major League Baseball Draft by the Chicago White Sox but choose to seek a career in the NFL. Hobert was a back-up quarterback for four seasons with the Raiders, then went on to play for the Buffalo Bills in 1997. He was initially expected to compete with Alex Van Pelt and Todd Collins for the starting quarterback position made vacant by Jim Kelly's retirement; however, after a notorious incident in Buffalo where he publicly admitted that he was unprepared to play, he was promptly released. He was acquired later that season by the New Orleans Saints, where he remained until 1999. The Saints traded him in 2000 to the Indianapolis Colts. While on the Colts roster for two years, he did not play a snap during the regular season.

Trafton won by decision after five rounds. He fought three more bouts in early 1930 before meeting future world champion Primo Carnera in Kansas City on March 26, 1930. Trafton was knocked out by Carnera in the first round of their fight. In the aftermath of the fight, Trafton was suspended indefinitely by the Missouri Boxing Commission for failing to provide more resistance in the 54 second bout.Trafton later became the head coach of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Western Interprovincial Football Union from 1951 to 1953.

VWillie \u201cThe Wisp\u201d Galimore (March 30, 1935 \u2013 July 27, 1964) was an American football running back for the Chicago Bears from 1957\u20131963. He attended Florida A&M University, working with the legendary coach Jake Gaither. Galimore is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame.Galimore possessed incredible speed and lateral movement; many of the opposing players of the time stated that they believed Galimore could run side-to-side down the field just as fast as most men could in a straight line. His running style could be said to most resemble the style of Billy Sims or perhaps Terrell Davis, but faster.In a documentary short by NFL Films on Galimore, it was said that he was probably the last great find before NFL scouting became sophisticated. Bears assistant coach Phil Handler, while scouting for talent in Florida, received a tip about Galimore's prowess as a halfback, and the Bears subsequently drafted him in the 5th round of the 1956 NFL draft. Galimore's peers (including Chuck Bednarik and Doug Atkins) referred to Galimore as one of the best runners they ever faced.Galimore was killed in an automobile accident on July 27, 1964 in Rensselaer, Indiana at the age of 29 with teammate Bo Farrington. His number 28 has been retired by the Bears.His son, Ron Galimore, was the first Black U.S. Olympic gymnast.Willie Galimore's last visit to his hometown of St. Augustine, Florida came just weeks before his death, and he participated in civil rights demonstrations there, becoming the first Black person who was able to register as a guest at the previously all-white Ponce de Leon Motor Lodge (where the arrest of the 72-year-old mother of the governor of Massachusetts for trying to be served in a racially integrated group had made national headlines a few months before). Galimore's civil rights activism is honored with a Freedom Trail marker at his home at 57 Chapin Street in St. Augustine. His widow, Mrs. Audrey Galimore, took part in the dedication of the marker on July 2, 2007. A community center in the historic Lincolnville neighborhood of the city also bears Galimore's name, and he is depicted on a historical mural painted by schoolchildren on Washington Street.

VElmer Angsman (December 11, 1925 \u2013 April 11, 2002) was an American football running back in the NFL.He was born on the south side of Chicago in 1925, the son of Elmer and Helen Angsman. Elmer attended Mount Carmel High School and also starred for Notre Dame in college from 1943 to 1945(playing on the 1943 National Championship team 1943 college football season and the College All-Star team that defeated the world champion Cleveland Rams.), played 7 seasons in the NFL, all with the Chicago Cardinals. After graduating from Notre Dame in three years with a degree in journalism, Angsman was the youngest player ever drafted to play in the NFL at the age of 20 with the 16th overall pick of the 1946 draft. Angsman was part of Charles Bidwill\u2019s "Dream Backfield". Although Bidwill did not live to see it, the talented corps that included Charley Trippi, Paul Christman, Pat Harder, and Angsman went on to achieve great success. In the 1947 NFL championship game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Angsman scored twice on runs of 70 yards each. The final touchdown, a run up the middle like the first against Eagle coach Greasy Neale's famed 5-2-4 defense, put the game out of reach. Angsman finished the game with 10 carries for 159 yards. His 15.9 yard per carry average is still an NFL post-season record (10 carries or more). The 1947 title was the Cardinal franchise's last championship. Don Paul, a former defensive back for the Cardinals and later the Cleveland Browns, once said "He was...A straight ahead north and south runner who would just as soon leave cleat marks on your balls as run around you."Angsman and the Cardinals never reclaimed the glory of the 1947 championship season. In 1948, Angsman led the Cardinals in rushing, with 412 yards and 7 touchdowns, and the Cards edged the Chicago Bears for the West Conference title. They met the Eagles once again in the 1948 NFL Championship Game title game now referred to as "The Blizzard Bowl". The field was covered by snow and the entire game was played in a storm. The Cardinals running attack was greatly hampered and the Eagles star Steve Van Buren was the only player who could run effectively in the conditions. Angsman mustered only 33 yards on 10 carries. Only 5 passes were completed by both teams combined. Van Buren's 5 yard TD run in the fourth quarter was the only scoring as the Eagles won their first championship, 7-0.The Cardinals' visionary coach, Jimmy Conzelman, quit after the 1948 season and the Cardinals drifted into mediocrity. Angsman had his best season in 1949 with 674 yards rushing on 125 carries and 6 TDs. He, Pat Harder, and Charlie Trippi shared running duties and combined for 1674 yards and 16 TDs that year (in comparison, Steve Van Buren set the NFL single season rushing record in 1949 with 1146 yards). However, the future of NFL success lay in dynamic passing attacks such as that possessed by the Los Angeles Rams and Cleveland Browns. Angsman's production fell off significantly in 1950 and 1951, with 363 and 380 yards, respectively, and an average under 3.5 yards per carry. By 1952, with stunning rookie halfback Ollie Matson joining the club, Angsman was relegated to a seldom-used backup role. He retired after the 1952 season at age 27. He finished with career statistics of 683 carries, 2908 yards (4.3 avg), and 27 touchdowns. He caught 41 passes for 654 yards and 5 touchdowns. Angsman was selected to the first ever Pro Bowl 1951 Pro Bowl in 1950.After his NFL career, Angsman was a color commentator beginning in 1958 with CBS Radio CBS Radio, later ABC American Football League on ABC and finishing with NBC List of NFL on NBC announcers in 1972. Angsman called college and pro games most notably the 1968 Sugar Bowl and several Orange Bowl games. He is a member of the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame. Angsman owned various companies after commentating finding success in paper manufacturing and eventually retiring to Juno Beach, Florida. In April 2002, Elmer Angsman died of a heart attack while playing golf with lifelong friends.He is survived by wife-Diane Angsman, son-John Angsman, grandchildren- Jim Angsman, Jeff Angsman, Jackie Angsman, Jay Angsman, Joe Angsman

VGary John Ballman (July 6, 1940 \u2013 May 20, 2004) was an American football wide receiver in the National Football League. Ballman starred at Michigan State before playing halfback and wide receiver for the Pittsburgh Steelers from 1962 to 1966, making the Pro Bowl the final two seasons. He is among the team\u2019s career leaders in kickoffs (64 returns for 1,711 yards), with the second-best average of 26.7. His 93-yard return against Washington on Nov. 17, 1963, is tied for seventh-longest in team history. He played for the Philadelphia Eagles from 1967 to 1972, then split his final season between the New York Giants and the Minnesota Vikings. Ballman later worked for the National Football League Players Association until 1979 and as a building products salesman in Colorado before retiring in 2003.

VTony Terrell Hollings (born December 1, 1981 in Macon, Georgia) is a former American football running back. He was originally selected in the second round of the 2003 NFL Supplemental Draft out of Georgia Tech by the Houston Texans.Because of knee surgery when he was at Georgia Tech, Hollings went nearly a year between games, but he regained durability throughout his rookie season and showed promise. On September 21 against the Kansas City Chiefs, in his first non-special teams action, he tore off 41 yards on 7 carries. He wound up starting a game late in the '03 season. Ex-coach Dom Capers said Hollings gave the team \u201csome speed and burst\u201d. Hollings was given the nickname "Superman" during his college career because of the way he "flew" over defensive opponents.In 2008 he played for the Dresden Monarchs in the German Football League as starting Halfback. One year later he was traded to the Berlin Adler but suffered a season-ending injury.

VWilliam Valentine "Bill" Shakespeare (September 27, 1912 \u2013 January 17, 1974) was an American football player. He played at the halfback position, and also handled punting, for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football teams from 1933 to 1935. He gained his greatest acclaim for throwing the winning touchdown pass as time ran off the clock in Notre Dame's 1935 victory over Ohio State, a game that was voted the best game in the first 100 years of college football. Shakespeare was selected as a consensus first-team All-American in 1935 and was posthumously inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983. Sharing the same name as "The Bard of Avon", Shakespeare earned nicknames including "The Bard of Staten Island", "The Bard of South Bend", and "The Merchant of Menace."

VBernardo Harris (born October 15, 1971) is a former American football linebacker in the National Football League. He attended Chapel Hill High School, graduating in 1990. He was recruited by Mack Brown to play at the University of North Carolina and graduated in 1994. After not being drafted, he was signed as a free agent by the Kansas City Chiefs in 1994. At Kansas City, Harris injured his knee in the first week of training camp and was out of football.Bernardo Harris became a free agent and was signed by the Green Bay Packers in 1995, playing in eleven games his rookie season. Harris played for the Green Bay Packers for seven seasons  and played on the 1996 Super Bowl XXXI and 1997 Super Bowl XXXII teams.In 2002, Harris was signed as a free agent by the Baltimore Ravens, after a shoulder injury to Ray Lewis. In 2003, Bernardo Harris was placed on the injured reserved and subsequently retired.Significant Contributions To the NFLWhile Bernardo Harris was playing for the Green Bay Packers in the January 3, 1999 playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers, Harris caused a controversial fumble which would largely be recognized as the precursor to video replay in the NFL.Towards the end of the 1999 playoff game, a pass was caught by Hall of Fame wide-receiver Jerry Rice, following the catch, Bernardo Harris stripped Jerry Rice of the ball, and was recovered by the Green Bay Packers. The game appeared to be won by the Green Bay Packers. However, the call on the field was that Rice was down by contact and San Francisco retained possession. Video replay showed that Rice has fumbled the ball, however, at that time replay was not used in the NFL. The 49ers went on to defeat the Green Bay Packers on that drive, by a final score of 30-27. Due to the controversial Harris call, the NFL announced the following season that it would begin instituting video replay.

He was blind in one eye, from a childhood incident, but nevertheless served in the U.S. Army for two years during World War II, which put his professional career on hold.Born in Hutchinson, Kansas, Thompson graduated from R. L. Paschal High School in Fort Worth, Texas, and played college football at the University of Tulsa.Thompson was an off-and-on starter for the Philadelphia Eagles, and led them to three consecutive NFL championship appearances, including the 1948 and 1949 title-winning seasons. His 25 touchdown passes led the league in 1948 and he led to victory in the championship game over the defending champion Chicago Cardinals in a snowstorm, avenging their loss in the previous year. Thompson also played on in the Canadian Football League for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in 1953.Thompson is one of three inactive NFL quarterbacks with multiple championships who were not inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, along with Jim Plunkett and Jack Kemp. Ray Didinger of CSNPhilly ranked him in the Top 5 all-time Eagles quarterbacks, citing his contribution to the championship teams. It is projected under the Harlor Formula that Thompson would have made 4 Pro Bowls.Thompson battled brain cancer for over a year and died in 1989 in Calico Rock, Arkansas.

VAlbert A. "Luby" DiMeolo (October 27, 1903 \u2013 June 17, 1966) was an American football player and coach. He was the second ever head coach for the Pittsburgh Pirates (later renamed the Steelers) of the National Football League. He coached the Pirates during their second season of 1934. He was born in Youngstown, Ohio, but lived nearly his entire life in Coraopolis, Pennsylvania, just west of Pittsburgh.DiMeolo was a guard and captain on the 1929 University of Pittsburgh team that was undefeated before losing in the 1930 Rose Bowl to USC. Upon graduating from Pittsburgh, DiMeolo served as offensive line coach at New York University under head coach Chick Meehan and later Howard Cann.When the Pittsburgh Pirates joined the NFL in 1933, DiMeolo was rumored to be the leading candidate to become the team's initial player-coach. He was passed over for the job in favor of Jap Douds, who lasted just a single season as the team's coach. DiMeolo replaced Douds for the team's second season. He led the Pirates to a disappointing 2\u201310 record in his first season, after which he was dismissed.After leaving the Pirates, DiMeolo returned to the college ranks as an assistant coach at Westminster College (Pennsylvania) and later at Carnegie Tech. He joined the navy during World War II and served as a physical instructor, rising to the rank of lieutenant commander.After leaving the navy, DiMeolo worked in the Pennsylvania state Department of Commerce, before losing his position due to a change in the political party running the government. He was shortly thereafter named a U.S. Marshal for western Pennsylvania. He served as Marshal until 1961, after which he worked for U.S. Steel.DiMeolo was married to Amelia Ann Sciliano; the couple had no children. He died at the age of 62 of a heart attack which occurred shortly after he had completed a game of squash in 1966.

He is most notable for his game winning 64-yard touchdown reception from Cleo Lemon against the Baltimore Ravens on December 16, 2007. The play won the Dolphins the game 22\u201316 in overtime and was the team's first win after thirteen consecutive losses to begin the year. It was also the only game the Dolphins won the entire season and allowed them to narrowly avoid becoming the first 0\u201316 team in NFL history (which was later achieved by the Detroit Lions in the 2008 season).

VGreg Schorp is a former tight end for Texas A&M University who went on to play professionally for the NFL's Dallas Cowboys, Seattle Seahawks, and Jacksonville Jaguars. Schorp won All-Southwest Conference honors in from 1991\u201393 and was a first-team selection the latter two years. As a senior, he received honorable mention All-American recognitionSchorp was a star at San Antonio Churchill High School, and played immediately as a freshman in 1990 in spite of being on a loaded Texas A&M squad that pounded 13th ranked BYU 65-14 in the Holiday Bowl.He caught seven passes as a sophomore in 1991, as the Aggies won the first of three straight SWC titles during his Aggie tenure. The following year, Schorp had 24 receptions for 280 yards, becoming the first tight end to lead the Aggies in receptions since Rod Bernstine in 1986, almost helping the Aggies complete a perfect year, as they remained undefeated until the last game of the season, losing to #5 Notre Dame in the Cotton Bowl Classic.Schorp's senior season was his finest as an Aggie. In the 1992 season-opener, Schorp\u2019s 21-yard touchdown catch in the fourth quarter pulled A&M even with Stanford - the only TD the Aggies would score that day as they went on to win a 10-7 nailbiter. Schorp caught four passes for 68 yards against the Cardinal and was named the Most Valuable Player of the Disneyland Pigskin Classic. The catch he is most remembered for by Aggie fans cames three games later at Kyle Field in College Station. With the #5 Aggies trailing Texas Tech 17-16 with time running out in the fourth quarter on a third-and-long play, quarterback Jeff Granger broke away from Tech's Dusty Beavers to avoid a sack deep behind the line of scrimmage. Granger, who had been inconsistent all day, somehow managed to duck under the tackle and scrambled to find Schorp, who made a diving 13-yard catch for a first down. That catch saved the game for the Aggies and set up a Terry Venetoulias field goal as time expired, giving the Aggies a 19-17 win against their hated rival. It was the second of nine consecutive wins that season for the Aggies, who finished the season with a tough 21-24 loss to #4 Notre Dame in the Cotton Bowl Classic.Schorp went on to play in the NFL, mostly as a reserve for Seattle Seahawks, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Dallas Cowboys, with which he had two stints, and was given a Super Bowl XXX championship ring in 1996. As a member of the team's practice squad; Greg was given a Super Bowl ring, as were members of the teams office staff and various employees of the organization.He is, to date, the last tight end to earn first-team all-conference honors for the Aggies.

VVince Goldsmith, born July 20, 1959, was a star football player in the Canadian Football League (CFL), as both a linebacker and defensive lineman.Playing his college football with the University of Oregon Ducks (from 1977 to 1980) as a defensive tackle and only 5 feet 11 inches (but 230 pounds,) Goldsmith earned first-team all-conference honors twice while becoming the school\u2019s only defensive lineman ever to receive the Morris Trophy as top lineman. A 1980 second-team Associated Press All-American, he recorded 13 tackles in his collegiate debut and his most productive year was as a sophomore, when he tallied 87 tackles (62 unassisted) and 14 tackles for losses. He finished his collegiate career with 281 tackles, including 34 behind the line of scrimmage. He was inducted into the University of Oregon Hall of Fame in 2002.Thought too small for the National Football League, Goldsmith came to Canada and played for 10 years. He made an instant impression in 1981, with the Saskatchewan Roughriders, recording 17 sacks, being named an all star and winning the CFL's Most Outstanding Rookie Award. He was also an all Canadian all star in 1983. He played with the Green Riders from 1981 to 1983, and from 1988 to 1990; in his second stint with the Green Riders, he appeared in the team's Grey Cup win in 1989, playing 101 games, and his 89 sacks are second in team history. He played 17 games for the Toronto Argonauts in 1984, and played 3 years (1985 to 1987) with the Calgary Stampeders.His career total of 130.5 sacks is fifth best in CFL history.

VAdam James Lingner (born November 2, 1960 in Indianapolis, Indiana) is a former American football offensive lineman who played thirteen seasons in the National Football League with the Kansas City Chiefs and the Buffalo Bills. Lingner was drafted in 1983 in the 9th round by the Kansas City Chiefs, and was the lowest draft pick to make the squad. He was a member of Buffalo's teams in four consecutive Super Bowl games: Super Bowl XXV, Super Bowl XXVI, Super Bowl XXVII and Super Bowl XXVIII.Adam Linger is most known for being the long-snapper on the "wide right" field goal by Scott Norwood in Super Bowl XXV. Most football experts agree that the snap on the play was perfect and not a factor in the kick being missed. Lingner is also one of only 22 players to play in all of the Buffalo Bills Super Bowl appearances in the early 1990s.

VStacy Ladell Robinson (February 19, 1962 \u2013 May 8, 2012) was a professional American football wide receiver in the NFL for the New York Giants.Robinson's most notable game was in week 13 of the 1986 season, when the Giants were playing the 49ers on Monday Night Football. The Giants trailed 17-0 at halftime, but scored three touchdowns in the third quarter to win the game. Robinson caught the second touchdown, a 34-yard pass from Phil Simms, but he made an incredible grab on a 49-yard pass from Phil Simms, down to the 1-yard line, to set up the Giants' final score. He finished with 5 catches for a career high 116 yards receiving as the Giants won 21-17. The Giants went on to win Super Bowl XXI that season over the Denver Broncos, and Robinson caught three passes for a team high 62 receiving yards in the big game.

VDale Leonard Hackbart (born July 21, 1938) is a former American football defensive back who played twelve seasons in the National Football League for the Green Bay Packers, Washington Redskins, Minnesota Vikings, St. Louis Cardinals, and Denver Broncos from 1960 to 1973. He also played in the Canadian Football League for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in 1964 and 1965.Hackbart initially focused on baseball. He spent a season playing baseball for the Grand Forks Chiefs; a Class C minor league team in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization. Bud Grant convinced Hackbart to drop baseball and concentrate on a career in the National Football League.Hackbart was drafted by the Minnesota franchise in the inaugural 1960 American Football League Draft as a quarterback and "territorial selection." He was drafted in the fifth round of the 1960 NFL draft as a generic "back" by the Packers. As Minnesota would never play in the AFL (the group instead joined the NFL as the Minnesota Vikings), Hackbart joined the Packers. Hackbart would eventually join the Vikings in 1966, by this point solely as a defensive back.In 1973, Hackbart was involved in an on-field transgression that he eventually took to court. He asserted that a late hit by Cincinnati Bengals running back Boobie Clark was an intentional tort.He was with the Denver Broncos and was their starting safety in 1973.In the first 1973 regular season game against the Cincinnati Bengals Hackbart's neck was fractured. "It was just before halftime and the Bengals had the ball at around the 45 yardline going in. Boobie Clark came out of a split backfield and ran down the hashmarks. I was playing free safety so I dropped back to the center of the field. The ball went up in the air and I converged into the endzone. Billy Thompson, who was playing left corner for the Broncos, jumped in front of me and Boobie Clark and intercepted the pass. I tried to block Boobie and landed on the ground. When I came up on to one knee watching Thompson run the ball, Boobie came up from behind me and whacked me in the back of the head, with a right fore-arm and drove me into the ground, after the Play was finished. My left arm went numb ! At halftime in the locker room I couldn\u2019t take off my helmet so I was packed in ice around my neck and helmet." Hackbart did not at the time report the happening to his coaches or to anyone else during the game. However, because of the pain which he experienced he was unable to play golf the next day. He did not seek medical attention, but the continued pain caused him to report this fact and the incident to the Bronco trainer who gave him treatment. Apparently he played on the specialty teams for two successive Sundays, but after that the Broncos released him on waivers. (He was in his thirteenth year as a player.) He sought medical help and it was then that X-rays were taken, which revealed that the C4, 5, 6, and 7 vertebrae on his neck were fractured. This injury ended his football career.In 1974 neurosurgeons told Hackbart that if he didn\u2019t have surgery to repair the damage, he would lose use of his left arm, shoulder, and any muscles involved with the damaged vertebrae. The Broncos claimed they were not liable. Hackbart hired an attorney, Rodger Johnson of Johnson & Mahony, and brought a suit against the Bengals. Hackbart V. the Cincinnati Bengals became a precedent setting case. In the case the courts ruled that in the course of a professional football game an intentional infliction of an injury by one player upon another might constitute a tort.As a result of the lawsuit, the National Football League mandated that all stadiums had to be equipped with X-Ray machines. The head slap maneuver which injured Hackbart was banned. Later, rules against spearing with the helmet and helmet to helmet contact were created. Hackbart settled with the Bengals and the Broncos filed a Workman's Compensation claim which paid for the surgery that was performed in 1976.The case was eventually appealed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in 1979 and has become a key point of discussion in several first year law school tort classes. Hackbart v. Cincinnati Bengals, Inc., 601 F.2d 516 (10th Cir. 1979).

The following year, Cline was named the most valuable player in the Big Ten Conference, rushing for 936 yards as Ohio State built up a 7\u20132 record and was ranked 12th in the AP Poll. Following a brief stint in the U.S. Army at the end of World War II, Cline returned to Ohio State for a final season in 1947.Cline began his professional career by signing with the Browns, a team in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) coached by former Ohio State head coach Paul Brown. Cleveland won all of its games and the AAFC championship in 1948 while Cline served as a backup to fullback Marion Motley. Cleveland traded Cline to the Buffalo Bills, where he spent the 1949 season, and joined the Lions in 1950 when the AAFC folded. The Lions won the NFL Championship Game in 1952 and 1953, beating the Browns both times. Cline then retired from football and earned a master's degree in education. He later worked at a variety of school systems in Ohio and Arizona. Cline was inducted into the Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame and was named to the Ohio State Football All-Century Team in 2000. He died in 2001.

VRonald Dixon (born May 28, 1976 in Wildwood, Florida) is a former American football wide receiver for the New York Giants in the National Football League. His most notable performance was his 97 yard kick return for a touchdown in Super Bowl XXXV. Dixon's return was the only score for the Giants as they went on to lose to the Baltimore Ravens 34-7. He also recorded a 97-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in the Giants win over the Philadelphia Eagles in the Divisional playoffs that year. As a result, he holds the record for the most kickoff returns for a touchdown in a postseason campaign (2).Dixon's career was once promising but was prematurely ended by a PCL injury in his left knee.Ron had try outs with the Miami Dolphins and the New Orleans Saints in the spring of 2005, but his knee injury was not healed enough for him to be effective, so he officially retired from the NFL as a vested veteran in 2005.Dixon has now moved to Orlando, Florida where he is a health insurance agent and the Director of Public Relations for the Tenncom Group, an insurance agency and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) brokerage. He is now in the process of developing a health/disability insurance program for athletes to insure against career ending injuries.Ron Dixon was once an intern on the Shannon Burke Show which aired on Real Radio in Orlando Florida. He also coached at Olympia High School. Dixon is an alumnus of Wildwood High School.
